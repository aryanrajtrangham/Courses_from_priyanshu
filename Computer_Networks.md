### Definition - Computer Network

- A computer network is a set of nodes connected by communication links
- A node can be a computer, printer or any other device capabele of sending / receiving data generated by other nodes in the network
  - Example: computer, server, printer, security camera etc.
- A communication link can be wired link or wireless link. The link carries the information.
  - links:  wired : cable, wireless: air.

 End devices  | Intermediary devices
--------------|---------------------
 PC           | Router
 Printer      | Wireless Router
 Server       | Cell Tower
 Tablet       | Modem
 Smart Phone  | Internet card

### Basic characteristic of computer network

- Fault tolerance
  - The ability to:
    - Continue working despite failure
    - Ensure no loss of service
- Scalability
  - The ability to:
    - Grow based on the needs
    - Have good performance after growth
- Quality of Service (QoS)
  - The ability to:
    - Set Priorities
    - Manage data traffic to reduce data loss, delay etc
- Security
  - The ability to prevent:
    - Unauthorized access
    - Misuse
    - Forgery
  - The ability to provide:
    - Confidentiality
    - Integrity
    - Availability

### Network Protocols and Communication

- Data communication are the exchange of data between two nodes via some form of link (transmission medium) such as a cable.

- Data flow
  - Simplex:
    - Communication is undirectional
    - One device can transmit and the other device will receive
    - Example: keyboards, traditional monitors.
  - Half duplex
    - Communication is in both directional but not at the same time.
    - If one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa
    - Example: Walkie-talkies
  - Full deplex/ Duplex
    - Communication is in both directions simultaneously.
    - Device can send and receive at the same time.
    - Example: Telephone line.

- Protocols
  - All communication schemes will have the following things in common
    - Source or sender
    - Destination or receiver
    - Channel or media
  - Rules or protocols govern all methods of communication.
  - It is a set of rules that govern data communication.
  - Protocols determines
    - What is communicated ?
    - How it is communicated ?
    - When it is communicated ?
  - Protocols used in network communications also define
    - Message encoding
    - Message formatting and encapsultion
    - Message timing
    - Message size
    - Message delivery options
  - These are also known as elements of protocol
