### Network Protocols and Communication

- Data communication are the exchange of data between two nodes via some form of link (transmission medium) such as a cable.

- Data flow
  - Simplex:
    - Communication is undirectional
    - One device can transmit and the other device will receive
    - Example: keyboards, traditional monitors.
  - Half duplex
    - Communication is in both directional but not at the same time.
    - If one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa
    - Example: Walkie-talkies
  - Full deplex/ Duplex
    - Communication is in both directions simultaneously.
    - Device can send and receive at the same time.
    - Example: Telephone line.

- Protocols
  - All communication schemes will have the following things in common
    - Source or sender
    - Destination or receiver
    - Channel or media
  - Rules or protocols govern all methods of communication.
  - It is a set of rules that govern data communication.
  - Protocols determines
    - What is communicated ?
    - How it is communicated ?
    - When it is communicated ?
  - Protocols used in network communications also define
    - Message encoding
    - Message formatting and encapsultion
    - Message timing
    - Message size

### Classification of Computer Network

- Local Area Network (LAN)
  - A local Area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computer within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.
  - LAN devices :
    - Wired LAN (Ex: Ethernet- Hub, Switch)
    - Wireless LAN (Ex: Wi-Fi)

- Metropolitan Area network (MAN)
  - A metropolitan area network is a computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area (City).
  - MAN devices :
    - Swithces/Hub
    - Router/Bridges

- Wide Area Network (WAN)
  - A wide area network (WAN) is a telecomunications network that extends over a large geographical area for the primary purpose of computer networking.
  - WAN devices :
    - End devices and intermediary devices

- New Trends
  - Bring your own device (BYOD)
  - Online collaboration
  - Cloud computing

- Storage Area network (SAN)
  - It is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
  - Google drive
  - Azure storage service

### Network Topology

- Arrangement of nodes of a computer network.
- Topology = Layout
  - Physical Topology - Placement of various nodes.
  - Logical Topology - Deals with the data flow in the network

- Bus topology
  - All data transmitted between nodes in the network is transmitted over this *common transmission medium* and is able to be received by all nodes in the network simultaneously.
  - A signal containing the address of the intended receiving machine travels from a source machine in *both direction* to all machines connected to the bus until it finds the intended recipient.
  - Advantages |  Disadvantages
    -----------|-----------------
    Only one wire - less expensive | Not fault tolerant (No redundancy)
    Suited for temporary network   | Limited cable length
    Node failure does not affect other | No security

- Ring topology (Token ring topology)
  - A ring topology is a bus topology in a closed loop.
  - Peer-to-peer LAN topology
  - Two connections: one to each of its nearest neighbors
  - Unidirectional
  - Sending and receiving data takes place with the help of a *TOKEN*.
  - Advantages |  Disadvantages
    -----------|-----------------
    Performance better than Bus topology | Unidirectional. Single point of failure will affect the whole network
     _ | More load decreases the performance
     _ | Can cause bottleneck due to weak links
    All nodes with equal access | No security

- Star topology
  - Every node is connected to a central node callled a hub or switch
  - Centralized Management
  - All traffic must pass through the hub or switch
  - Advantages | Disadvantages
    -----------|----------------
    Easy to design and implement. | Single point of failure affects the whole network.
    Centralized administration. | Bottleneck due to overloaded switch/Hub.
    Scalable. | Increased cost due to switch/hub.
  - Two star topologies can be connected by a repeater.

- Mesh topology
  - Each node is directly connected to every other nodes in the network
  - Fault tolerant and reliable.
  - Advantages | Disadvantages
    -----------|----------------
    Fault tolerant. | Issues with braodcasting messages
    Reliable | Expensive and impractical for large networks

- Hybrid topology
  - It contains one or more topologies

### Basic of IP addressing

- IP Adressing
  - IP stands for Internet Protocol.
  - Every node in the computer network is identified with the help of IP address.

- IP Address (IPV4)
  - Every node in the computer network is identified with the help of IP address.
  - Logical address: We can change based on the location of the device.
  - Assigned by manually or dynamically.
  - Represented in decimal and it has 4 octets (x.x.x.x).
  - 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (32 bits).

### Basics of MAC addressing

- MAC stands for Media Access Control.
- MAC address = Physical address
- Every node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAC address.
- IP Address = Location of a person
- MAC Address = Name of the person

- MAC Address
  - Every node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAC address
  - Physical address or Hardware Address
  - Unique, cannot be cahnged
  - Assigned by the manufacturer
  - Represented in haxadecimal
  - Example: 70-20-84-00-ED-FC (48 bits)
  - Seperator: hyphen(-), period(.) and colon(:)

 IP address | MAC Address |
-----------|-------------
 Needed for communication. | Needed for communication.
 32 bits | 48 bits
 Represented in decimal. | Represented in hexadecimal.
 Router needs IP Address to forward data | Switch needs MAC address to forward data.
 Example : 10.10.23.56 | Example : 70-20-84-00-FD-FC

### Basics of Port addressing

- Derivations from analogy
  - Reaching our city = Reaching our network (IP address)
  - Reaching our Apartment = Reaching the host (MAC address)
  - Reaching the right person = Reaching the right process (Port address)

- Port Address or Port Numbers
  - In a node, many processes will be running
  - Data which are sent/received must reach the right process
  - Every process in a node is uniquely identified using port numbers
  - Port = Communication endpoint
  - Fixed port numbers and dynamic port numbers (0 - 65535)
  - Example :
    - Fixed port numbers: 25, 80 etc.
    - OS assigned dynamic port numbers: 62414.
  - Three key points : Before sending the data , any node must
    - Attach source IP address and destination IP address.
    - Attach source MAC address and destination MAC address.
    - Attach source port number and destination port number.

### Switching Techniques

- Swithching in computer network helps i deciding the best route for data transmission if there are multiple path in a larger network
- One-to-One connection.
- Switching Techniques
  - Circuit Switching
    - A dedicated path is established between the sender and receiver.
    - Before data transfer, connection will be established
    - Example: Telephone network
    - 3 phase in circuit switching
      - Connection establishment
      - Data transfer
      - Connection disconnection

  - Message Switching
    - Store and forward mechanism
    - Message is transferred as a complete unit and forwarded using store and forward mechanism at the intermediary node.
    - Not suited for streaming media and real-time applications.

  - Packet Switching
    - The internet is a packet switchd network.
    - Message is broken into individual chunks called as *packets*
    - Each packet is sent individually.
    - Each packet will have *source and destination IP address* with sequence number.
    - Sequence numbers help the receiver to -
      - Reorder the packets
      - Detect missing packets and
      - Send acknowledgments
    - Two approaches to packet switching
      - Datagram Approach
        - Datagram Packet Switching is also known as *connectionless switching*.
        - Each independent entity is called as datagram
        - Datagrams contain destination information and the intermediary device uses this information to forward datagrams to right destination.
        - In datagram Packet Switching aproach, the path is not fixed.
        - Intermediate nodes take the routing decisions to forward the packets
      - Virtual Circuit Approach
        - Virtual Circuit Switching is also known as *connection-oriented switching*.
        - In the case of Virtual circuit switching, a preplanned route is established before the messages are sent.
        - Call request and call accept packets are used to establish the connection between sender and receiver.
        - In this approach, the path is fixed for duration of a logical connection.

### Layering in Computer Networks

- Layering
  - Layering means decomposing the problem into more manageable components (layers).
  - Advantages :
    - It provides more modular design.
    - Easy to troubleshoot.

- Protocols
  - It is a set of rules that govern data communication.
  - The *protocols* in each layer governs the activities of the data communication.

- Layered Architectures
  - The OSI reference model
    - OSI = Open System Interconnection
    - It is a model for understanding and designing a network architecture that is flexible, robust and interoperable
    - Developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO)
    - The OSI model is not a *protocol*.
    - It is only a guideline and hence it is refererred as OSI reference model.
    - The purpose of OSI model is to show how to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of underlying hardware and software.
    - The OSI model was never fully implemented. (It's just a guidline)

  - The TCP/IP model
    - TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.
    - The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed prior to the OSI model.
    - Therefore, the layers in the TCP/IP protocol suite do not exactly match those in the OSI model.
    - *TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol* made up of interactive modules, each of which provides a specific functionality.

### The OSI Reference Model

  - Pros
    - Cheaper than switches.
    - Works good for smaller network.
  - Cons
    - Issues with broadcast
    - No memory
    - Narmally runs in half duplex mode.

  - Reapeater regenerates the signal over the same network.
  - It operated at the physical layer.
  - They do not amplify the signal.
  - It is a 2 port device.

### Basics of Bridge

- Bridge = Repeater + Functionality of reading MAC address.
- It is a layer 2 device.
- It's also used for interconnecting two LANs on the *same protocol*.
- It is also a two port device.
- Types of Bridges
  - Transparent Bridges
    - These are the bridges in which the statoins are completely unaware of the bridge's existence.
    - Reconfiguration of the stations is unnecessary even if bridge is added or removed from network.
  - Source Routing Bridges
    - In these bridges, routing operation is performed by source station and the frame specifies which route to follow.

--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------
 Bridge works in data link layer.     | Router works in network layer.
 Through bridge, data or information is not store and sent in the form of packet. | Through router, data or information is store and sent in the form of packet.
 There are only two ports in bridge.  | There are more than two ports in router.
 Bridge connects two different LANs.  | Router is used by LAN as well as MAN for connection.
 In bridge, routing table is not used.| In routers, routing table is used.
 Bridge works on single broadcast domain.| Router works on more than single broadcast domain.
 Bridges are easy to configure.       | Routers are difficult to setup and configure.
 Bridge focuses on MAC address .      | Router focuses on protocol address.

### Physical Layer and Media

- Fundamental principles of Physical Layer
  - One of the major functions of the physical layer is to move data in the form of electromagnetic signals across a tranmission medium.
  - The data usable to a person or an application are not in a form that can be transmitted over a network.
  - For example, an image must first be changed to a form that transmission media can accept.
  - To be transmitted, data must be transformed to electromagnetic signals.

- Signal
  - It is a function that represents the variation of a physical quantity with respect to time.
  - Example: VAriation in temperature of a city in one day i.e. 24 hours.
  - Analog Signal
    - It is the signal that can take any value in the defined range.
    - All real-life signals are analog in nature
  - Digital Signal
    - It is the signal that can take on of the finite values at any given time.
    - In case of digital signals, we discretize both time and magnitude.

### Line Configuration

- In a network, two or more nodes are connected by a communication link.
- The communication link can be wired or wireless.
- For visualization purpose, links are imagined as a line drawn between two points.
- For communication to happen, two nodes must be connected to the same link at the same time.
- This is called as line configuration or *connection*.
- Types of Line Configuration
  - Point-to-point Connection
    - A point-to-point connection provides a dedicated link between two devices.
    - The entire capacity of the link is reserved for transmission betweeen those two devices.
  - Multipoint Connection
    - It is also called Multidrop configuration or Broadcast connection.
    - In this connecion, two or more devices share a single link.
    - Since more thatwo devices share the link, the capacity of the channel is shared now.
    - It can be spatial or temporal.

## Data link layer

- It is responsible for moving data(frames) from one node to another node.

### Link Layer Services

- Framing
  - The data link layer needs to pack bits into frames, so that each frame is ditinguishable from another.
  - Our postal system practices a type of framing.
  - The simple act of inserting a letter into an envelope separates one piece of information from another; the envelope serves as the delimiter.
- Physical Addressing
  - A frame is the encapsulation of header and trailer information with the packet.
  - In the header, the source and the destination MAC address are dealt.
- Flow Control
  - Flow Control is one of the duties of data link control sublayer.
  - The flow control in data link layer is end to end flow control.
  - Speed matching machanism.
  - Flow control coordinates the amount of data that can be sent before receiving an acknowledgement.
- Access Control
  - Media access control
- Error Control
  - Error Detection
  - Error Correction

### Sublayers of the Data Link Layer

  +----------------------------------------+--------------+
```

- LLC sublayer
  - Logical Link Control (LLC) or Data Link Control (DLC) sublayer
  - Handles communication between upper and lower layers.
  - Takes the network protocol data and adds control information to help deliver the packet to the destinstion. (Flow control)

- MAC sublayer
  - Constitutes the lower sublayer of the date link layer
  - Implemented by hardware, typically in the computer NIC.
  - Two primary responsibilities
    - Data encapsulation
      - Frame assembly before transmission and frame disassembly upon reception of a frame.
      - MAC layer adds a header and trailer to the network layer PDU.
      - Provides three primary functions
        - Framing
        - Physical Addressing or MAC Addressing.
        - Error control.
    - Media access control
      - Responsible for the placement of frames on the media and the removal of frames from the media.

### Framing

- Framing in the data link layer separates a frame distinguisable from another frame
- Frame = Header + Network Layer PDU + Trailer
- In packet switched network, the block of data called frames are exchanged between nodes, not bits streams.
- When node A wishes to transmit a frame to node B, it tells its adaptor to transmit a frame from the node's memory.
- This results in a sequence of bits being sent over the link.
- The adaptor on node B then collects together the sequence of bits arrivingg on the link and deposits the corresponding frame in B's memory.
- Types of Framing
  - Fixed-size framing
    - Here the size of the frame is fixed and so the frame length acts as delemiter of the frame.
    - Consequently, it does not require additional boundary bits to identify the start and end of the frame.
  - Variable-size framing
    - Here, the size of each frame to be transmitted may be different.
    - So additional mechanisms are kept to mark the end of one frame and the beginning of the next frame.
- Various framing Approaches
  - Bit Oriented
    - It simply views the frame as a collection of bits.
    - In bit-oriented framing, data is transmitted as a sequence of bits that can be interpreted in the upper layers both as text as well as multinedia data.
    - Bit Oriented Protocol
      - High-level Data Link Control (HDLC)
  - Byte Oriented
    - a.k.a Character Oriented Approach
    - One of the oldest approaches to framing.
    - Here each frame is viewed as a collection of bytes (characters) rather than bits.
    - Byte Oriented Protocols
      - Binary Synchronous Communication Protocol (BISYNC)
      - Digital Data Communication Message Protocol (DDCMP)
      - Point-to-point Protocol (PPP)
  - Clock Based Framing
    - The third approach to framing
    - Example = Synchronous Optical Network Protocol (SONET)

### High-level Data Link Control (HDLC)

- The Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) protocol developed by IBM is an example of a bit-oriented protocol.
- SDLC was later standardized by the ISO as the High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) protocol.
- Bit-Oriented protocol
- HDLC - Frame Format
    8         | 16         | variable length | 16  | 8
  ------------|--------------|---------------|-----|------------
    Begining </br> Sequence | Header | Body  | CRC | Ending</br> Sequence
  - Beginning and Ending Sequences: 01111110
    - This sequence is also transmitted during any times that the link is idle so that the sender and receiver can keep their clocks synchronized.
  - Header : Address and Control Field.
  - Body : Payload (Variable size)
  - CRC : Cyclic Redundancy Check - Error Detection
- Types of HDLC Frames
  - The type of frame is determine by the control field.
    - I-Frame : Information Frame (1st bit is 0)
    - S-Frame : Supervisory Frame (1st two bits are 10)
    - U-Frame : Un-numbered Frame (1st two bits are 11)

- Bit Stuffing : Bit stuffing refers to the insertion of one or more bits into a data transmission as a way to provide signaling information to a receiver. The receiver knows how to detect, remove or disregard the stuffed bits.

### Binary Synchronous Communication Protocol (BSC/ BiSYNC)

- It is a sentinel approach.
- Developed by IBM
- Also referred as BSC.
- It is a byte-oriented protocol.
- BiSync - Frame Format
   8    | 8    | 8    |          | 8    | variable length | 8    | 16
  ------|------|------|----------|------|-----------------|------|------
   SYN  | SYN  | SOH  | Header   | STX  | Body            | ETX  | CRC
  - Frames transmitted begining with leftmost field.
  - Beginning of a frame is denoted by sending a special SYN (synchronize) character.
  - Data portion of the frame is contained between special sentinel character STX (start of text) and ETX (end of text).
  - SOH : Start of Header.
  - DLE : Data Link Escape.
  - CRC : Cyclic Redundancy Check.

- Character Stuffing : Byte Stuffing or Character Stuffing is the process of adding one extra byte whenever there is a flag or escape character in the text.
  - This is done by data link escape(DLE) in BISYNC protocol.

### Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)

- It is a byte-oriented protocol.
- PPP is a datalink layer protocol.
- PPP is a WAN protocol and which is commonly run over Internet links.
- It is widely used in broadband communications having heavy loads and high speeds.
- It is used to transmit multiprotocol data between two directly connected (point-to-point) computers.
- PPP - Frame Format
   8     | 8     | 8     | 8/16   |           | 16       | 8
  -------|-------|-------|--------|-----------|----------|------
   Flag  |Address|Control|Protocol| Payload   | Checksum | Flag
  - Flag : 1 byte that marks the beginning and the end of the frame. The bit pattern of the flag is 01111110.
  - Address : 1 byte which is set to 1111,1111 in case of broadcast.
  - Control : 1 byte set to a constant value of 11000000.
  - Protocol : 1 or 2 bytes that define the type of data contained in the payload field.
  - Payload : This carries the data from the network layer. The maximum length of the payload is 1500 bytes. However, this may be negotiated between the endpoints of communication.
  - Checksum : Error detection

- Character Stuffing : Byte stuffing or Character stuffing is the process of adding one extra byte whenever there ia a flag sequence appear in the payload.

### Digital Data Communication Message Protocol (DDCMP)

- It is a byte-oriented protocol.
- Devised by Digital Equipment Corporation.
- It is a byte-counting appraoch
- Count field in the frame format
  - Count : How many bytes are contained in the frame body?
- DDCMP - Frame Format
   8    | 8    | 8     | 14    | 42     | variable length | 16
  ------|------|-------|-------|--------|-----------------|-------
   SYN  | SYN  | Class | Count | Header | Body            | CRC
  - Danger with the count field
    - One danger with this approch is that if transmission error could corrupt the count field then the end of the frame would not be correctly detected by the receiver.

### Error Detection

- Error
  - Data are transmitted in the network.
  - The data can be corrupted during transmission.
  - Transmission error.
  - For reliable communication, errors must be detected and corrected.
  - Error detection and correction are implemented either at the data link layer or the transport layer of the OSI model.
  - Types of error
    - Bit Error (single bit error)
      - In a single bit error, only 1 bit in the data unit has been changed.
    - Burst Error
      - In burst error, 2 or more bits in the data unit have changed.
  - Error detection
    - Error detection means to decide whether the received data is correct or not without having a copy of the original message.
    - To detect or correct errors, we need to send some extra bits with the data.
    - The extra bits are called as redundant bits.
  - Redundancy

    ```[]
    +---------------------+            +------------------------+
    |        Data         |            |                        |

               +-->[1011101] [101000000000010101]---+
    ```

  - Error Correction
    - It can be handled in two ways
      - Receiver can have the sender retransmit the entire data unit.
      - The receiver can use an eror-correcting code, which automatically corrects certain errors.

    ```[]

    ```

  - Error Detection techniques
    - Four types of redundancy checks are used in data communications.
      - Vertical Redundancy Check (VRC)
      - Logitudinal Redundancy Check (LRC)
      - Checksum (Internet Checksum / Arithmetic Checksum)
      - Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

### Vertical Redundancy Check (VRC)

- It's also called as parity check.
- Example

  ```[]
  Data   1100001 
            |     \
            |        \
        Even Parity     \                     Receiver
        Generator    [1][1100001] ---------------->
            |       /  Data Transmitted       11100001
            |    /
  VRC     [ 1 ]
  ```

- Performance of VRC
  - It can detect single bit error.
  - It can detect burst error only if the number of errors is odd.
  - Example:
    - Sender (11100001) --> Transmission Error (1 ${\color{lightblue}0}$ 100001) --> Receiver rejects this data
    - Sender (11100001) --> Transmission Error (1 ${\color{lightblue}0}$ 100 ${\color{lightblue}1}$ 01) --> Receiver accepts this data

### Longitudinal Redundancy Check (LRC)

- In LRC, a block of bit is organized in rows and columns.
- a.k.a Two Dimensional parity
- The parity bit is calculated for each column and sent along with the data.
- The block of parity acts as the redundant bits.
- Example

  ```[]
  Data -> 11100111 11011101 00111001 10101001
      1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1
      1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
      0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1
      1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1
      ---------------
      1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 <-- LRC
  ```

- Perforamnce of LRC
  - LRC increases the likelihood of detecting burst errors.
  - If two bits in one data units are damaged and two bits in exactly the same positions in another data unit are also damaged, the LRC checker will not detect an error.

### Checksum

- Check = Check + sum
- Sender side - Checksum Creation, Receiver side - Checksum validation
- Checksum - Operation at sender side
  - Break the original message into 'k' number of blocks with 'n' bits in each block.
  - Sum all the 'k' data blocks.
  - Add the carry to the sum, if any
  - Do's 1's complement to the sum = Checksum.
- Example
  - Sender

  ```[]
    Data -> 10011001111000100010010010000100
                1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
                1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
                0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
                1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
                ---------------
   Carrry (1 0) 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
                            1 0
                ---------------
                0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1
      1's       ---------------
    complement  1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 <- Checksum
    Data sent -> 10011001111000100010010010000100 11011010
  ```

  - Receiver
    - Collect all the data blocks including the checksum.
    - Sum all the data blocks and checksum
    - If the result is all 1's ACCEPT else REJECT.

  ```[]
    Data received -> 10011001111000100010010010000100 11011010
                1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1
                1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
                0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
                1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
                1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
                ---------------
   Carrry (1 0) 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1
                            1 0
                ---------------
    Result      1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  ```

- Performance of Checksum
  - The checksum detects all errors involving an odd number of bits.
  - It detects most errors involving an even number of bits.
  - if one or more bits of a segment are damaged and the corresponding bit or bits of opposite value in a second segment are also damaged, the sums of these columns will not change and the receiver will not detect the error(s).

### Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

- CRC Genaration at sender side
  - Find the length of the divisor 'L'.
  - Append 'L-1' bits to the original message.
  - Perform binary division operation.
  - Remainder of the division = CRC.
  - CRC must be of L-1 bits.
- Example
  - Sender

  ```[]
    divisor ______data___________
    1 1 0 1 | 1 0 0 1 0 0:0 0 0 | 1 1 1 1 0 1
              1 1 0 1
              ---------
                1 0 0 0
                1 1 0 1
                ---------
                  1 0 1 0
                  1 1 0 1
                  ---------
                    1 1 1 0
                    1 1 0 1
                    ---------
                        1 1 0
                        0 0 0
                        -------
                        1 1 0 0
                        1 1 0 1
                        ---------
                          0 0 1 <-- CRC code
    Data sent -> 1 0 0 1 0 0 (0 0 1)
  ```

  - Receiver

  ```[]
  Data received -> 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1

    divisor ______data___________
    1 1 0 1 | 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 | 1 1 1 0 1
              1 1 0 1

                  1 0 1 0
                  1 1 0 1
                  ----------
                    1 1 1 0
                    1 1 0 1
                    ---------

                        1 1 0 1
                        --------
                              0 <-- No errors found
  ```

### Network Performance

- Network performance is measure in following fundamentalal ways
  - Bandwidth
  - Throughput
  - Latency (Delay)

- Bandwidth
  - Informal: Maximum amount of data that can be transmitted per second.
  - Formal : The bandwidth of a network is given by the number of bits that can be transmittted over the network in a certain period of time.
  - Bandwidth in bps (wired medium)
    - Bandwidth = Capability
    - Example: Gigabit Ethernet can provide a bandwidth of 1 Gbps.
  - Bandwidth in hertz
    - A range of frequencies used to transmit signals which is measured in hertz.

- Throughout
  - Informal: Actual amount of data that passes through the medium.
  - Formal: The throughput is measure of how fast we can actually send data through a network.

- Although bandwidth in bits per second and throughput seem the same, they are different.
- A link may have a bandwidth of **'B'** bps, but we can only send **'T'** bps through this link with T < B always.

- Latency (Delay)
  - The latency or delay defines how long it takes for an entire message to completely arrive at the destination from the time the first bit is sent out from the source.
  - Latency is made of four components:
    - Transmission delay
    - Propagation delay
    - Queueing delay
    - Processing delay
  - Latency = Transmission delay + Propagation delay + Queueing delay + Processing delay

### Latency (Delay)

- Transmission Delay
  - Time it takes to place the complete data packet on the transmission medium.
  - Transmission time = Message size / Bandwidth

- Propagation Delay
  - Time it takes for a bit to go from device A to device B.
  - Propagation time = Distance / Propagation speed.

- Queuing Delay
  - Time needed for each intermediate or end device to hold the message before it can be processed.
  - The queuing time is not a fixed factor, it changes with the load imposed on the network.
  - When there is heavy traffic on the network, the queuing time increases.

- Processing Delay
  - Time a node takes to process the message.

### Bandwidth-delay Product

- The Bandwidth-delay product defines the number of bits that can fill the link.
- It is the capacity of the link.
- Volume in bits = Bandwidth in bps * Delay in s

### Round Trip Time ($R_{TT}$)

- a.k.a Round Trip Delay Time (RTD).
- It is the length of the time it takes for a signal to be sent plus the length of time it takes for an acknowledgement of that signal to be received.
- This time therefore consists of the propagation times between the two point of signal.
- If $T_{p}$ is the propagation time, then
   $R_{TT}$ = $2*T_{p}$

### Flow Control

- Speed matching mechanism.
- Flow control coordinates the amount of data that can be sent before receiving an acknowledgement.
- Flow control is a set of procedured that tells the sender how much data it can transmit before it must wait for an acknowledgement from the receiver.
- Receiver has a limited speed at which it can process incoming data and a limited amount of memory in which to store incoming data.
- Receiver must inform the sender before the limits are reached and request that the transmitter to send fewer frames or stop temporarily.
- Flow control protocol
  - Noiseless Channels
    - Simplest
    - Stop-and-wait
  - Noisy Channels
    - Stop-and-wait Automatic repeat request (ARQ)
    - Sliding window Protocol
      - Go-Back-N Automatic repeat request (ARQ)
      - Selective Repeat Automatic repeat request (ARQ)

### Stop-and-Wait Protocol

- Stop-and-Wait protocol is data link layer protocol for transmission of frames over noiseless channels.
- It provides undirectional data transmission with flow control facilities but without error control facilities.
- After transmitting one frame, the sender waits for an acknowledgement before transmitting the next frame.
- Primitives of Stop-and-wait Protocol
  - Sender side
    - Rule 1: Send one data packet at a time
    - Rule 2: Send the next packet only after receiving ACK for the previous
  - Receiver side
    - Rule 1: Receive and consume data packet.
    - Rule 2: After consuming packet, ACK need to be sent (Flow Control)
- Problems of Stop-and-wait protocol
  - Problem due to lost data
    - Sender waits for ack for an infinite amount of time.
    - Receiver waits for data an infinite amount of time.
  - Problems due to lost ACK.
    - Sender waits for an infinite amount of time for ACK.
  - Problem due to delayed ACK/data.
    - After timeout on sender side, a delayed ACK might be wrongly considered as ACK of some other data packet.

### Stop-and-Wait Automatic repeat request Protocol

- After transmitting one frame, the sender waits for an acknowledgement before transmitting the next frame
- If the ACK does not arrive after a certain period of time, the sender times out and retransmits the original frame.
- Stop-and-wait ARQ = Stop-and-Wait + Timeout Timer + Sequence number
- Scenarios
  - The ACK is received before the timer expires
  - The original frame is lost
  - The ACK is lost
  - The timeout fires too soon
- Drawbacks
  - One frame at a time.
  - Poor utilization of bandwidth
  - Poor Performance

### Sliding Window Protocol

- Send multiple frames at a time.
- Number of frames to be sent is based on *Window size*.
- Each frame is numbered -> Sequence Number.

### Go-Back-N ARQ

- 'N' is the sender window size
- Go-Back-N ARQ uses the concept of protocol pipeline i.e. the sender can send multiple frame before receiving the acknowledgement for the first frsme.
- There are finite number of frames and the frames are numbered in a sequential manner.
- The number of frames that can be sent depends on the window size of the sender.
- If the ACK of a frame is not received within an agreed upon time period, *all frames in the current window are transmitted*.
- The size of the sending windows determines the sequence number of the outbound frames.
- Example : if the sending windows size is 4 (${2^{2}}$), then the sequence numbers will be 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,0,1 and so on.
- The number of bits in the sequence number is 2 to generate the binary sequence 00, 01, 10, 11.

### Selective Repeat ARQ

- In Selective Repeat ARQ, only the erroneous or lost frames are retransmitted, while correct frames are received and buffered.
- The receiver while keeping track of sequence number, buffers the frames in memory and sends NACK for only frame which is missing or damaged.
- The sender will send/ ratransmit packet for which NARC is received.

### Multiple Access Protocols

- If there is a dedicated link between the sender and the receiver then data link control layer is sufficient, however if there is no dedicated link present then multiple stations access the channel simultaneously.
- Hence multiple access protocols are required to decrease collision and avoid crosstalk.
- Multiple-access protocols
  - Random access protocols
    - ALOHA
    - CSMA
    - CSMA/CD
    - CSMA/CA
  - Controlled-access protocols
    - Reservation
    - Polling
    - Token passing
  - Channelization protocols
    - FDMA
    - TDMA
    - CDMA

- To avoid acess conflict, each station follows a protocol (procedure).
  - When can the station access the meium ?
  - What can the station do if the medium is busy ?
  - How can the station determine the success or failure of the transmission ?
  - What can the station do if there is an access conflict ?

- Random Access Protocols
  - In this, all stations have superiority that is no station has more priority than another station. Any station can send data depending on medium's state (idle or busy).
  - In a Random access method, each station has the right to the medium without being controlled by any other station.
  - If more than one station tries to send, there is an access conflict (COLLISION) and frames will be either destroyed or modified.

- Controlled Access Protocols
  - In controlled access, the stations consult one another to find which station has the right to send.
  - A station cannot send unless it has been authorized by other stations.

- Channelization Protocols
  - Channelization is a multiple-access method in which the available bandwidth of a link is shared in time, frequency, or through code, between different stations.

### Aloha

- Aloha is a random access protocol.
- It was actually designed for WLAN but it's also applicable for shared medium..
- In this, multiple stations can transmit data at the same time and can hence lead to collision and data being garbled.
- Types
  - Pure Aloha
  - Slotted Aloha

- Pure Aloha
  - Pure ALOHA alows stations to transmit whenever they have data to be sent.
  - When a station sends data it waits for an ACK.
  - If the ACK doesn't come within the allotted time then the station waits for a random amount of time called *back-off time (Tb)* and re-sends the data.
  - Since different stations wait for different amount of time, the probability of further collision decreases.
  - The throughput of pure aloha is maximized when frames are of uniform length.
  - Whenever two frames try to occupy the channel at the same time, there will be a collision and both will be garbled.
  - If the first bit of a new frame overlaps with just the last bit of a frame almost finished, both frames will be totally destroyed and both will have to be retransmitted later.
  - Vulnerable Time = ${2*T_{fr}}$ , where (${T_{fr}}$) is the frame transmition time.
  - Throughput = ${G*e^{-2G}}$, where G is the number of stations wish to transmit in the same time.
  - Maximum throughput = 0.184 for G = 0.5 i.e. (1/2).

- Slotted Aloha
  - It was developed just to improve the efficiency of pure aloha as the chances for collision in pure aloha are high.
  - The time of the shared channel is divided into discreate time intervals called slots.
  - Sending od data is allowed *only at the beginning* of these slots.
  - If a station misses out the allowed time, i must wait for the next slot. This reduces the probablity of collision.
  - Vulnerable Time = ${T_{fr}}$ , where (${T_{fr}}$) is the frame transmition time.
  - Throughput = ${G*e^{-G}}$, where G is the number of stations wish to transmit in the same time.
  - Maximum throughput = 0.368 for G = 1

 Pure Aloha  | Slotted Aloha
-------------|----------------
 Any staion can transmit the data at any time. | Any station can transfer the data at the beginning of any time slot.
 The time is continuous and not globally synchronised. | The time is discreet and globally synchronised.
 Vulnerable time in which collision may occur = ${2*T_{fr}}$. | Vulnerable time in which collision may occur = ${T_{fr}}$.
 Probability of successful transmission of data packet = ${G*e^{-2G}}$. | Probability of successful transmission of data packet = ${G*e^{-G}}$.
 Maximum efficiency = 18.4% (Occurs at G = 1/2). | Maximum efficiency = 36.8% (Occurs at G = 1).
 Main advantage: Simplicity in implementation. | Main advantage: It reduces the number of collision to half and double the deficiency of pure aloha.

### Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)

- CSMA Protocol
  - Carrier Sense Protocol
  - To minimize the chance of collision and therefore, increase the performance, the CSMA method was developed.
  - Principle of CSMA: "sense before transmit" or "listen before talk"
  - Carrier busy = Transmission is taking place.
  - Carrier idle = No transmission currently taking place.
  - The probability of collision still exists because of propagation delay, a station may sense the medium and find it idle, only because the first bit sent by another station has not yet been received.
  - Types of CSMA
    - 1-Persistent CSMA
    - P-Persistent CSMA
    - Non-Persistent CSMA
    - O-Persistent CSMA
  - Modified
    - CSMA/CD (CSMA with Collision Detection)
    - CSMA/CA (CSMA with Collision Avoidance)

- 1-persistent CSMA
  - Before sending the data, the station first listens to the channel to see if anyone else is transmitting the data at that moment.
  - If the channel is idle, the station transmits a frame.
  - If busy, then it senses the transmission medium continously until it becomes idle.
  - Since the station transmit the frame with the probability of 1 when the carrier or chennel is idle, this scheme of CSMA is called as 1-Persistent CSMA.
  - The propagation delay has an important effect on the performance of the protocol.
  - The longer the propagation delay, the more important this effect becomes, and the worse the performance of the protocol.

- Non-Persistent CSMA
  - Before sending, a station senses the channel. If no one else is sending the station bgins doing so itself.
  - However, if the chennel is already in use, the station does not continually sense it for the purpose of seizing it immediately upon detecting the end of the previous transmission.
  - Instead, it wait a random period of time and then repeats the algorithm. Consequently, the algorithm leads to better channel utilization but longer than 1-persistent CSMA.

- P-persistent CSMA
  - It applies to slotted channels.
  - When a station becomes ready to send, it senses the channel.
  - If it is idle, it transmits with a probablity P.
  - With a probablity Q=1-P, it defers until the next slot.
  - If that slot is also idle, it either transmits or defers again, with probabilities P and Q.
  - This process is repeated until either the frame has been transmitted or another station has begun transmitting.
  - In the latter case, the unlucky station acts as if there had been a collision (i.e, it waits a random time and starts again).
  - If the station initially senses the channel busy, it waits until the next slot and applies the above algorithm.

- O-persistent CSMA
  - Each node is assigned a transmission order by a supervisory node.

- CSMA/CD (CSMA with Collision Detection)
  - If two stations sense the channel to be idle and begin transmitting simultaneously, they will both detect the collision almost immediately.
  - Rather than finish transmitting theor frames, which are irretrievably garbled anyway, they should abruptly stop transmitting as soon as the collision is detected.
  - Quickly terminating damaged frames saves time and bandwidth.
  - This protocol, known as CSMA/CD is widely used on LANs in the MAC sublayer.
  - Access method used by Ethernet: CSMA/CD.
  - Let's have point ${t_{0}}$, a station has finished transmitting its frame.
  - Any other station having a frame to send may now attempt to do so. If two or more station decide to transmit simultaneously, there will be a collision.
  - Collisions can be detected by looking at the power or pulse width of the received signal and comparing it to the transmitted signal.
  - After a station detects a collision, it aborts its transmission, waits a random period of time, and then tries again, assuming that no other station has started transmitting in the meantime.
  - Therefore, model for CSMA/CD will consist of alternating contention and transmission periods, with idle periods occurring when all stations are quiet
  - For gate
    - Efficiency = ${\frac{1}{1+ 6.44a}}$
    - a = ${\frac{T_{p}}{T_{t}}}$
    - If distance increases, efficiency of CSMA decreases.
    - CSMA is not suitable for long distance networks like WAN; but works optimally for LAN.
    - If length of packet is bigger, the efficiency of CSMA also increases, but maximum limit for length is 1500 Bytes.
    - Transmission Time >= Round Trip Time of 1 bit
    - Transmission Time >= 2*Propagation Time

- CSMA/CA (CSMA with Collision Avoidance)
  - Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is a network multiple access method in which carrier sensing is used, but nodes attempt to avoid collisions by beginning transmission only after the channel is sensed to be "idle".
  - It is particulary important for wireless netwrorks, where the collision detection of the alternative CSMA/CD is not possible due to wireless transmitters desensing their receivers during packet transmission
  - CSMA/CA is unreliable due to the hidden node (terminal) and exposed node (terminal) problem.
  - Solutions are RTS/CTS exchange.
  - CSMA/CA is a protocol that operates in the DAta Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
  - The access method used by IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi is CSMA/CA.

### Reservation

- A station need to make a reservation before sending data.
- In each interval, a reseervation frame precedes the data frames in that interval.
- If there are N stations in the system, there are exactly N reservation minislots in the reservation frame.
- Each minislot belongs to a station.
- When a station needs to send a data frame, it makes a reservation in its own minislot.
- The stations that have made reservations can send their data frames after the reservation frame.

### Polling

- The polling protocol requires one of the nodes to be designated as a Master node (Primary station).
- The master node polls each of the nodes in a round-robin fashion.
- In particular, the master node first sends a message to node 1, saying that (node 1) it can transmit up to some maximum number of frames.
- After node 1 transmit some frames, the master node tells node 2 (node 2) it can transmit up to the maximum number of frames.
- The master node can determine when a node has finished sending its frames by observing the lack of a signal on the channel.
- The procedure continues in this manner, with the master node polling each of the nodes in a cyclic manner.
- Advantages
  - The polling protocol eliminates the collision.
  - This allows polling to achieve a much higher efficiency.
- Disadvantages
  - The first drawback is that the protocol introduces a polling delay the amount of time required to notify a node that it can transmit.
  - The second drawback, which is potentially more serious, is that if the master node fails, the entire channel becomes inoperative.
- Polling - Function
  - Poll function : If the primary wants to receive data, it asks the secondaries if they have anything to send.
  - Select function : If the primary wants to send data, it tells the secondary to get ready to receive.
- Efficiency of Polling
  - Let ${T_{poll}}$ be the time for polling and ${T_{t}}$ be the time required for transmission of data. Then, Efficiency = ${\frac{T_{t}}{T_{t} + T_{poll}}}$

### Token Passing

- A station is authorized to send data when it receives a special frame called a token.
- Here there is no master node.
- A small, special-purpose frame known as a token is exchanged among the nodes in some fixed order.
- When a node receives a token, it holds onto the token only if it has some frames to transmit; otherwise, it immediately forwards the token to the next node.
- If a node does have frames to transmit when it receives the token, it sends up to a maximum number of frame and then forwards the token to the next node.
- Token passing is decentralized and highly efficient, but it has problems as well.
- Example
  - The failure of one node can crash the entire channel.
  - If a node accidentally neglects to release the token, then some recovery procedure must be invoked to get the token back in circulation.
- Types of networks
  - Physical ring
  - Dual ring
  - Bus ring
  - Star ring
- Performance of token passing
  - ${S = \frac{1}{1 + a/N}    : for a<1}$
  - ${S = \frac{1}{a(1 + 1/N)} : for a>1}$
  - ${a = \frac{T_{p}}{T_{t}}}$
  </br>where
    - S = Throughput
    - N = number of stations
    - ${T_{p}}$ = Propagation  delay
    - ${T_{t}}$ = Transmission  delay

#### Multiplexing

- Multiplexing in computer networking means multiple signals are combined together thus travel simultaneously in a shared medium.
- Multiplexing = Sharing the bandwidth.

### Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)

- In FDMA, the available bandwidth of the common channel is divided into bands that are separated by guard bands.
- The available bandwidth is shared by all stations.
- The FDMA is a data link layer protocol that uses FDM at the physical layer.

### Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)

- In TDMA, the bandwidth is just one channel that is time shared between different stations.
- The entire bandwidth is just one channel
- Stations share the capacity of the channel in time.

### Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

- In CDMA, one channel carries all transmissions simultaneously.
- CDMA differs from FDMA because only one channels occupies the entire bandwidth of the link.
- It differ from TDMA because all station can send data simultaneously, there is no time sharing.
- The assigned codes have two properties:
  - If we multiply each code by another, we get 0.
  - If we multiply each code by itself, we get the number of stations (4).
  - Example:
    - Data = (${d_{1}c_{1}}$ + ${d_{2}c_{2}}$ + ${d_{3}c_{3}}$ + ${d_{4}c_{4}}$)*${c_{1}}$ = 4 ${d_{1}}$

### Ethernet

- One of the most widely used Wired LAN technologies.
- Operates in the data link layer and the physical layer.
- Family of networkingtechnologies that are defined in the IEEE 802.2 and 802.3 standards.
- Support data bandwidth of 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 40000 and 100000Mbps (100Gbps).
- Ethernet Standards
  - Define Layer 2 protocols and Layer 1 technologies.
  - Two seperate sublayers of the data link layer to operate - Logical Link control (LLC) and the MAC sublayers.
- Ethernet evolution
  - Standard Ethernet 10 Mbps
  - Fast Ethernet 100 Mbps
  - Gigabit Ethernet 1 Gbps
  - Ten-Gigabit Ethernet 10 Gbps
- Ethernet Frame Format
  - Preamble: 56 bits of alternating 1s and 0s.
  - SFD: Start frame delimiter, flag (10101011)
  - Physical layer header : first 8 bytes

   Preamble | SFD    | Destination address | Source address | Length or type | Data & padding | CRC
  ----------|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|---------
   7 bytes  | 1 byte | 6 bytes             | 6 bytes        | 2 bytes        |                | 4 bytes

- Ethernet Frame - Min and Max Length
  - Minimum payload length : 46 bytes
  - Maximum payload length : 1500 bytes

   Destination address | Source address | Length PDU     | Data & padding | CRC
  ---------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|---------
   6 bytes             | 6 bytes        | 2 bytes        |                | 4 bytes
  
  - Minimum frame length: 512 bits or 64 bytes
  - Maximum frame length: 12144 bits or 1518 bytes

- Ethernet Address
  - Example - 06:01:02:03:2C:4B <=> 6 bytes <=> 12 hex digits <=> 48 bits
  - The least significant bit of the first bytes defines the type of address.
  - If the bit is 0, the address is unicast, otherwise, it's multicast.
    - Example:  10101010 <- unicast, 10101011 <- multicast address.
  - If all bits are 1, then it is broadcast address.

- Access Protocol For Ethernet
  - The algorithm is commonly called Ethernet's Media Access Control (MAC) which is implemented in Hardware on the network adaptor.
  - Access Method of Ethernet: CSMA/CD
  - Encoding method: Manchester Encoding Technique for converting data bit into signals.

- Ethernet Transmitter Algorithm
  - When the adaptor has a frame to send and the line is idle, it transmits the frame immediately.
  - The upper bound of 1500 bytes in the message means that the adaptor can occupy the line for a fixed length of time.
  - When the adaptor has a frame to send and the line is busy, it wait for the line to go and then transmits immediately.
  - The ethernet is said to be CSMA 1-persistent protocol beacuse an adaptor with a frame to send transmits with probability 1 whenever a line goes idle.
  - Since there is no centralized control it is possible for two (or more) adaptors to begin transmitting at the same time, either because both found the line to be idle or both had been waiting for a busy line to become idle.
  - When this happen, the two (or more) frames are said to be collide on the network.
  - Since ethernet support collision detection, each sender is able to determine that a collision is in progress.
  - At the moment an adaptor detects that its frame is colliding with another, it first makes sure to transmit a 32-bit jamming sequence and then stops transmission.
  - Thus, a transmitter will minimally send 96 bits in the case of collision 64-bit preamble + 32-bit jamming sequence.
  
- Runt Frames
  - Runt Frames is an Ethernet frame that is less than the IEEE 803.3's minimum length of 64 bytes.
  - Runt frames are most commonly caused by collisions.
  - Other possible causes are a malfunctioning network card, buffer underrun, duplex mismatch or software issues.

- Exponential Backoff
  - Once an adapter has detected a collision and stopped its transmission, it waits a certain amount of time and tries again.
  - Each time the adaptor tries to transmit but fails, it doubles the amount of time it wait before trying again.
  - This strategy of doubling the delay interval between each retransmission attempt is known as Exponential Backoff.

- Ethernet - Pros
  - Ethernet is the most widely used wired LAN technology.
  - Ethernet is relatively inexpensive.
  - In ethernet, all the node have the same priviledges. It does not folllow client-server architecture.
  - Maintenance and administration are simple.
  - The cable used to connect systems in ethernet is robust to noise.
  - As it is robust to the noise, the quality of the data transfer does not degrade. The data transfer quality is good.
  - With latest versions such as gigabit ethernet, the transfer speeds in Gbps have become possible.

- Ethernet - Cons
  - Under heavy loads, too much of the network's capacity is wasted by collisions.
  - It does not hold good for real-time application and interactive applications.
  - As the network cannot set priority for the packets, it is not suitable for a client-server architecture.
  - For interactive application, dummy data have to be fed to make the farme size 46B which in mandatory.
  - After receiving a packet, the receiver doesn't send any acknowledgement.

- Ethernet CATS

### IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi

- Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi)
  - Like its Ethernet and token ring siblings, 802.11 is designed for use in a limited geographical area (homes, office buildings, campuses).
  - Primary challenge is to mediate access to a shared communication medium - in this case, signals propagating through space.
  - 802.11 supports additional features
    - power management and
    - security mechanisms
  - 802.11 uses 5 GHz Radio Band (High frrequency) which has 23 non-overlapping channels rather than the 2.4 GHz frequency band which has only three non-overlapping channels.
  - Access Methos of IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi: CSMA/CA
  - Modes of Wi-Fi
    - Infrastructure mode
    - Ad hoc and Wi-Fi Direct

    Legacy 802.11  | 2.4GHz          | 20 MHz             | 2 Mbps

- Distribution System
  - 802.11 is suitable for an ad-hoc configuration of nodes that may or may not be able to communicate with all other nodes.
  - Nodes are free to move around
  - The set of directly reachable nodes may change over time.
  - To deal with this mobility and partial connectivity,
    - 802.11 defines additional structure on a set of nodes.
    - Instead of all nodes being created equal,
      - some nodes are allowed to roam and some are connected to a wired network insfrastructure, they are called Access Points (AP) and they are connected to each other by a so-called *distribution system*.
  - Access points connected to a distributed network.

    ```[]
       +------------------------+
       | Distribution system    |
       +------------------------+
       | AP-1 / \  AP-2 | AP-3  |
       | A   | B |   H  | G   F |
       |   C  \ /  D   / \  E   |
       +-------+------+   +-----+
    ```

    - Assume a distribution system that connects three access points, each of which services the nodes in the same region.
    - Each of these regions is analogous to a cell in a cellular phone system with the APIs playing the same role as a base station.
    - Although two nodes can communicate directly with each other if they are within reach of each other, the idea behind this configuration is
      - Each nodes associates itself with one access point.
      - For node A to communicate with node E, A first sends a frame to its AP-1 which forwards the frame across the distribution system to AP-3, which finally transmits the frame to E.
    - How does the nodes select their AP ?
      - The technique for selecting an AP is called *scanning*.
        - The node sends a Probe frame.
        - All APs within reach reply with a Probe Response frame.
        - The node selects one of the one of the access points and sends that AP an Association Request frame.
        - The AP replies with an Association Response frame.
      - A node engages this protocol whenever it joins the network as well as
      - When it becomes unhappy with its Access Point (AP)?
        - This might happen, for example, because the signal from its current AP has weakened due to the node moving away from it.
        - Whenever a node acquires a new AP, the new AP notifies the old AP of the change via the distribution system.
    - Consider the situation when node C moves from the cell serviced by AP-1 to the cell serviced by AP-2.
      - As it moves, it sends Probe frames, which eventually result in Probe Responses from AP-2.
      - At some point, C prefers AP-2 over AP-1, and so it associates itself with that access point. This is called *active scanning* since the node is actively searching for an access point.
      - APs also periiodically sends a Beacon frame that advertises the capabilities of the access point, these include the transmission rate supported by the AP.This is called *passive scanning*.
      - A node can change to this AP based on the Beacon frame simply by sending it an Association Request frame back to the access point.

  - Suppose both A and C want to communicate with B and so they each send it a frame.
    - A and C are unaware of each other since their signals do not carry that far.
    - These two frames collide with each other at B (but unlike an ethernet, neither A nor C is aware of this collision).
    - A and C are said to hidden nodes with respect to each other.
  - Solution to hidden terminal problem.

  ```

  - Suppose B is sending to A. Node C is aware of this communication because it hears B's transmission.
    - It would be a mistake for C to conclude that it cannot transmit to anyone just because it can hear B's transmission.
    - Suppose C want to transmit to node D.
    - This is not a problem since C's transmission to D will not interfere with A's ability to receive from B.
  - Solution to exposed terminal problem.
    - Multiple Access Collision Avoidance (MACA) Algorithm - RTS and CTS frames

- Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (MACA)
  - 802.11 addredsses these two problems with an algorithm called Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (MACA).
  - Key idea : Sender and receiver exchange control frames with each other before the sender actually transmit any data.
  - This exchange informs all nearby nodes that a transmission is about to begin.
  - Sender transmit a *Request to Send (RTS)* frame to the receiver
    - The RTS frame includes a field that indicates how long the sender wants to hold the medium. Length of the data frame to be transmitted.
  - Receiver replies with a *Clear to Send (CTS)* frame
    - This frame echoes this length field back to the sender
  - Any node that sees the CTS frame knows that
    - it is close to the receiver, therefore
    - cannot transmit for the period of time it takes to send a frame of the specified length
  - Any node that sees the RTS frame but not the CTS frame
    - is not close enough to the receiver to interface with it, and
    - so is free to transmit

  - The idea of using ACK in MACA is Proposed in MACAW : MACA for wireless LANs.
  - Receiver sends an ACK to the sender after successfully receiving a frame.
  - All nodes must wait for this ACK before trying to transmit
  - If two or more nodes detect an idle link and try to transmit an RTS frame at the same time.
    - Their RTS frame will collide with each other.
  - *802.11 does not support collision detection*.
    - So the sender realize the collision has happened when they do not receive the CTS frame after a period of time.
    - The amount of time a given node delay is defined by the same *exponential backoff algorithm* used on the Ethernet.

### IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth

- Bluetooth
  - Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for exchanging data betweeen fixed and mobile devices over short distances using short-wavelength ultra high frequency (UHF) radio waves in the industrial scientific medical (ISM) radio bands from 2.400 to 2.485 GHz and building area networks (PANs).
  - It was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables.
  - Bluetooth is a wireless technology named after Harald Bluetooth based on an analogy that Bluetooth technology would unite devices the way Harald Bluetooth united the tribes of Denmark into a single kingdom.
  - Bluetooth is specified by an industry consortium called the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG).
  - It specifies an entire suite of protocols, going beyond the link layer to define application protocols, which it calls profiles, for a range of applications.
    - There is a profile for synchronizing a personal digital assistance (PDA) with personal computer.
    - Another profile gives mobile computer access to a wired LAN.
  - The basic Bluetooth network configuration is called piconet.
    - Consists of a master device and up to seven slave devices.
    - Any comminication is between the master and a slave.
    - The slaves do not communicate directly with each other.
    - A slave can be parked: set to an inactive, low-power state.
    - The complex configuration of the piconet results in scatternet.
  - Pros
    - Low cost
    - Easy to use
    - It can also penetrate through walls.
    - It creates an ad-hoc connection immediately without any wires.
    - It is used for voice and data transfer.
  - Cons
    - It can be hacked and hence, less secure.
    - It has slow data transfer rate.
    - It has small range : 10 meters.

- Bluesnafing
  - Bluesnafing is the unauthorized access of information from a wireless device thorugh a Bluetooth connection, ofter between phones, desktops, laptops and PDAs.
  - This allows access to calenders, contact lists, email and text messages, and on some phones, users can copy pictures and private videos.
  - Bluesnarfing is the theft of information from the target device.

  - Physical Radio (RF) layer : It performs modulation/demodulation of the data into RF signals. It defines the physical characteristics of bluetooth transceiver. It defines two types of physical link : connection-less and connection-oriented.
  - Baseband Link Layer : It performs the connection establishment within a piconet.
  - Link Manager protocol layer : It performs the management of the already established links. It also includes authetication and encryption processes.
  - Logical Link Control and Adaption protocol layer : It is also known as the heart of the bluetooth protocol stack. It allows the communication between upper and lower layer of the bluetooth protocol stack. It packages the data packets received from uper layers into the form expected by lower layers. It also performs the segmentation and multiplexing.
  - RF comm layer : It is short fo Radio Frontend Component. It provides serial interface with wireless application protocol (WAP) and object exchange (OBEX).
  - TCS : It is short for Telephony Control Protocol. It provides telephony service.
  - SDP layer : It is short for Service Discovery Potocol. It allows to discover the services available on another bluetooth enables device.
  - Application layer : It enables the user to interact with the application.

### Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)

- A VLAN is a logical partitioning of a layer 2 network.
- Multiple partitions can be created, allowing for multiple VLANs to co-exixt.
- Each VLAN is a broadcast domain, usually with its own IP network.
- VLANs are mutually isolated and packets can only pass between then via a router.
- The partitioning of layer 2 network takes place inside a layer 2 device, usually via a switch.
- The hosts grouped with a VLAN are unaware of the VLAN's existence.
- Types of VLAN
  - Data VLAN
  - Default VLAN
  - Native VLAN
  - Management VLAN
  - Voice VLAN
- Pros
  - Security
  - Cost reduction
  - Better performance
  - Shrinks broadcast domains.
  - Improved IT staff efficiency.
  - Simpler project and application management.

  ```

  - Frame tagging is the process of adding a VLAN identification header to the frame
  - It is used to properly transmit multiple VLAN frames through a trunk link.
  - Switches tag frames to identify the VLAN to that they belong. Different tagging protocol exist; IEE802.1Q is very popular example.
  - The protocol defines the structure of the tagging header added to the frame.
  - Switches add VLAN tags to the frames before placing then into trunk links and remove the tag before forwarding frames through no-trunk ports.
  - When properly tagged, the frames can transverse any number of switches via trunk links and still be forwarded within the correct VLAN at the destination.

### IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

- Redundancy
  - Enables users to access network resources, despite path disruption.
    - improves reliability
    - improves availability
  - In technology, 2 is 1 and 1 is none, single connection mean single point of failure.
    - Creating redundant links is very simple and is advisable.

- Key Facts - STP
  - Original STP (802.1D) was created to prevent loops.
  - Switches send probes into the network to discover loops.
  - These probes are called as Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU).
  - BPDU will have specific information about the switch.
  - Switch multicasts BPDU probes (every 2 second) and if it receives its own BPDU back, it means there is a loop in the network.
  - Also the BPDU probes helps to elect the root bridge.
  - All switches will find the best way to reach the root bridge and the redundant links will be blocked (Port cost).

    ```[]
      +---------------------------------------------+
      |            BPDU (Bridge ID)                 |
      +-----------------+---------------------------+
      | Bridge Priority | MAC address of the switch |
      +-----------------+---------------------------+
    ```

  - Root Bridge
    - The Root Bridge will have the lowest bridge id.
    - If Tie, the bridge with the lowest MAC address will be the Root bridge.
  - Port Roles
    - Root Port (Used to reach the root bridge)
    - Designated Port (Forwarding port: One per link)
    - Blocking/Non Designated Port (Loops)

- Spanning Tree Protocol
  - STP ensures that there is only one logical path between all destinations on the network by intentionally blocking redundant paths that could cause a loop.
  - A port is considered blocked when user data is prevented from entering or leaving that port. This does not include bridge protocol data unit (BPDU) frames that are used by STP to prevent loops.
  - The physical parts still exist to provide redundancy, but these paths are disabled to prevent the loop from occurring.
  - If the path is even needed to compensate for a network cable or switch failure, STP recalculate the paths and unblocks, the necessary ports to allow the redundant path to become active.

## Logical Addressing & Subnetting

### IPv4 Addresses

- An IPv4 address is a 32-bit address that uniquely and universally defines the connection of a device (for example, a computer or a router) to the Internet.
- An IPv4 address is 32 bits long.
- Two devices on the Internet can never have the same address at the same time.
- The address space of IPv4 is ${2^{32}}$ or 4,294,967,296 (more than 4 billion).
- Notation : binary notation = 01110101 10010101 00011101 00000010, decimal notation = 117.149.29.2

  - To define the network and host portions of an address, devices use a separate 32-bit pattern called a subnet mask.
  - The subnet mask does not actually contain the network or host portion of an IPv4 address, it just says where to look for these portions in a given IPv4 address.

### IPv4 transsmission

- In an IPv4 network, the hosts can communicate one of three different ways
  - Unicast
    - Unicast Transmission : The process of sending a packet from one host to an individual host.
  - Broadcast
    - Broad Transmission : The process of sending a packet from one host to all hosts in the network.
    - Limited Broadcast : Destination 255.255.255.255
      - Router do not forward a limited broadcast.
    - Directed broadaast : Destination 172.16.4.255
      - Host within the 172.16.4.0/24 network
  - Multicast
    - Multicast Transmission : The process of sending a packet from one host to a selected group of hosts, possibly in different networks.
      - Multicast transmission reduces traffic
      - The Multicast Address range : 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
      - Link local - 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255 (Example : routing information exchanged by routing protocols)
      - Globally scoped addresses - 224.0.1.0 to 238.255.255.255 (Example 224.0.1.1 has been reserved for Network Time Protocol)

### Private and Public IP Addresses

- Private IP Addresses
  - Early network design, when global end-to-end connectivity was envisioned for communicatons with all Internet hosts, intended that IP addresses be globally unique. However, it was found that this was not always necesary as private networks developed and public address space needed to be conserved.
  - Computers not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only with each other TCP/IP, need not have
  globally unique IP addresses. Today, such private networks are widely used and typically connect to the Internet with network address translation (NAT), when needed.
  - Hosts that do not require access to the Interenet can use private addresses
    - 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
    - 172.16.0.0 to 173.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
    - 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)
  - The aforementioned are the three non-overlapping ranges of IPv4 addresses for private networks are reserved.

- Special use IPv4 Addresses
  - Network and Broadcast addresses - within each network the first and last addresses cannot be assigned to hosts.
  - Loopback address - 127.0.0.1 a special address that hosts use to direct traffic to themselves (addresses 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 are reserved).
  - Link-Local address - 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255 (169.254.0.0/16) addresses can be automatically assigned to the local host.
  - Test-net addresses - 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255 (192.0.2.0/24) set aside for teaching and learning purposes, used in documentation and network examples.
  - Experimental addresses - 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254 are listed as reserved.

- In a nutshell..
  - Private IP address is used to communicate within the same network.
  - Using private IP data or information can be sent or received within the same network.

  - Public Ip address is used to communicate outside the network. Public IP address is basically assigned by the Internet Service Provider(ISP).
