### Definition - Computer Network

- A computer network is a set of nodes connected by communication links
- A node can be a computer, printer or any other device capabele of sending / receiving data generated by other nodes in the network
  - Example: computer, server, printer, security camera etc.
- A communication link can be wired link or wireless link. The link carries the information.
  - links:  wired : cable, wireless: air.

 End devices  | Intermediary devices
--------------|---------------------
 PC           | Router
 Printer      | Wireless Router
 Server       | Cell Tower
 Tablet       | Modem
 Smart Phone  | Internet card

### Basic characteristic of computer network

- Fault tolerance
  - The ability to:
    - Continue working despite failure
    - Ensure no loss of service
- Scalability
  - The ability to:
    - Grow based on the needs
    - Have good performance after growth
- Quality of Service (QoS)
  - The ability to:
    - Set Priorities
    - Manage data traffic to reduce data loss, delay etc
- Security
  - The ability to prevent:
    - Unauthorized access
    - Misuse
    - Forgery
  - The ability to provide:
    - Confidentiality
    - Integrity
    - Availability

### Network Protocols and Communication

- Data communication are the exchange of data between two nodes via some form of link (transmission medium) such as a cable.

- Data flow
  - Simplex:
    - Communication is undirectional
    - One device can transmit and the other device will receive
    - Example: keyboards, traditional monitors.
  - Half duplex
    - Communication is in both directional but not at the same time.
    - If one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa
    - Example: Walkie-talkies
  - Full deplex/ Duplex
    - Communication is in both directions simultaneously.
    - Device can send and receive at the same time.
    - Example: Telephone line.

- Protocols
  - All communication schemes will have the following things in common
    - Source or sender
    - Destination or receiver
    - Channel or media
  - Rules or protocols govern all methods of communication.
  - It is a set of rules that govern data communication.
  - Protocols determines
    - What is communicated ?
    - How it is communicated ?
    - When it is communicated ?
  - Protocols used in network communications also define
    - Message encoding
    - Message formatting and encapsultion
    - Message timing
    - Message size
    - Message delivery options
  - These are also known as elements of protocol
  - Message encoding

    ```[]
      Message ==> Encoder  ==> Transmitter ==> Transmitter ==> Receiver ==> Decoder  ==> Message
      Source      (Signal)                      Medium                      (Signal)    Destination
    ```

  - Message formatting and encapsultion
    - Agreed format
      - Encapsulation the information to identify the sender and the receiver rightly.
  - Message size
    - Humans break long messages into smaller parts or sentences.
    - Long messages must also be broken into smaller pieces to travel across a network.
  - Message Timing
    - Flow control
    - Response Timeout
  - Message delivery options
    - Unicast
    - Multicast
    - Broadcast

- Types of computer network
  - Peer-to-peer Network
    - No Centralized administration
    - All peers are equal
    - Simple sharing appications
    - Not scalable
  - Client Server Network (request-response model)
    - Centralized administration
    - Request-Response model
    - Scalable
    - Server may be overloaded

- Components of a computer network
  - Nodes
    - End nodes (End devices)
      - Computer
      - Network Printers
      - VoIP Phones
      - Telepresence endpoint
      - Security cemeras
      - Mobile handheld devices (Smart phones, tablets, Personal Digital Assistances, Wireless debit/credit card reader, barcode scanner)
    - Intermediary nodes (intermediary devices)
      - Switches
      - Wireless acess Point

      - Hubs
      - Repeaters
      - Cell Tower
  - Media
    - Wired medium (Guided medium)
      - Ethernet straight-through cable (connects two devices of different kind)
      - Ethernet crossover cable (connects two devices of same kind)
      - Fiber optic cable
      - Coaxial cable
      - USB cable (Universal serial bus)
    - Wireless medium (unguided medium)

      - Microwaves (Ex: Callular System)
      - Satellite (Ex: long range communication - GPS)
  - Services
    - e-mail
    - storage services
    - file sharing
    - instant messaging
    - online game
    - VOIP (voice over IP)
    - video telephone
    - www (world wide web)

### Classification of Computer Network

- Local Area Network (LAN)
  - A local Area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computer within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.
  - LAN devices :
    - Wired LAN (Ex: Ethernet- Hub, Switch)
    - Wireless LAN (Ex: Wi-Fi)

- Metropolitan Area network (MAN)
  - A metropolitan area network is a computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area (City).
  - MAN devices :
    - Swithces/Hub
    - Router/Bridges

- Wide Area Network (WAN)
  - A wide area network (WAN) is a telecomunications network that extends over a large geographical area for the primary purpose of computer networking.
  - WAN devices :
    - End devices and intermediary devices

- New Trends
  - Bring your own device (BYOD)
  - Online collaboration
  - Cloud computing

- Storage Area network (SAN)
  - It is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
  - Google drive
  - Azure storage service
