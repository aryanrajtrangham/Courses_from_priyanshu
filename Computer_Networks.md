### Definition - Computer Network

- A computer network is a set of nodes connected by communication links
- A node can be a computer, printer or any other device capabele of sending / receiving data generated by other nodes in the network
  - Example: computer, server, printer, security camera etc.
- A communication link can be wired link or wireless link. The link carries the information.
  - links:  wired : cable, wireless: air.

  - The ability to provide:
    - Confidentiality
    - Integrity
    - Availability

### Network Protocols and Communication

- Data communication are the exchange of data between two nodes via some form of link (transmission medium) such as a cable.

- Data flow
  - Simplex:
    - Communication is undirectional
    - One device can transmit and the other device will receive
    - Example: keyboards, traditional monitors.
  - Half duplex
    - Communication is in both directional but not at the same time.
    - If one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa
    - Example: Walkie-talkies
  - Full deplex/ Duplex
    - Communication is in both directions simultaneously.
    - Device can send and receive at the same time.
    - Example: Telephone line.

- Protocols
  - All communication schemes will have the following things in common
    - Source or sender
    - Destination or receiver
    - Channel or media
  - Rules or protocols govern all methods of communication.
  - It is a set of rules that govern data communication.
  - Protocols determines
    - What is communicated ?
    - How it is communicated ?
    - When it is communicated ?
  - Protocols used in network communications also define
    - Message encoding
    - Message formatting and encapsultion
    - Message timing
    - Message size
    - Message delivery options
  - These are also known as elements of protocol
  - Message encoding

    ```[]
      Message ==> Encoder  ==> Transmitter ==> Transmitter ==> Receiver ==> Decoder  ==> Message
      Source      (Signal)                      Medium                      (Signal)    Destination
    ```

  - Message formatting and encapsultion
    - Agreed format
      - Encapsulation the information to identify the sender and the receiver rightly.
  - Message size
    - Humans break long messages into smaller parts or sentences.
    - Long messages must also be broken into smaller pieces to travel across a network.
  - Message Timing
    - Flow control
    - Response Timeout
  - Message delivery options
    - Unicast
    - Multicast
    - Broadcast

### Classification of Computer Network

- Local Area Network (LAN)
  - A local Area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computer within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.
  - LAN devices :
    - Wired LAN (Ex: Ethernet- Hub, Switch)
    - Wireless LAN (Ex: Wi-Fi)

- Metropolitan Area network (MAN)
  - A metropolitan area network is a computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area (City).
  - MAN devices :
    - Swithces/Hub
    - Router/Bridges

- Wide Area Network (WAN)
  - A wide area network (WAN) is a telecomunications network that extends over a large geographical area for the primary purpose of computer networking.
  - WAN devices :
    - End devices and intermediary devices

- New Trends
  - Bring your own device (BYOD)
  - Online collaboration
  - Cloud computing

- Storage Area network (SAN)
  - It is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
  - Google drive
  - Azure storage service

### Network Topology

- Arrangement of nodes of a computer network.
- Topology = Layout
  - Physical Topology - Placement of various nodes.
  - Logical Topology - Deals with the data flow in the network

- Bus topology
  - All data transmitted between nodes in the network is transmitted over this *common transmission medium* and is able to be received by all nodes in the network simultaneously.
  - A signal containing the address of the intended receiving machine travels from a source machine in *both direction* to all machines connected to the bus until it finds the intended recipient.
  - Advantages |  Disadvantages
    -----------|-----------------
    Only one wire - less expensive | Not fault tolerant (No redundancy)
    Suited for temporary network   | Limited cable length
    Node failure does not affect other | No security

- Ring topology (Token ring topology)
  - A ring topology is a bus topology in a closed loop.
  - Peer-to-peer LAN topology
  - Two connections: one to each of its nearest neighbors
  - Unidirectional
  - Sending and receiving data takes place with the help of a *TOKEN*.
  - Advantages |  Disadvantages
    -----------|-----------------
    Performance better than Bus topology | Unidirectional. Single point of failure will affect the whole network
     _ | More load decreases the performance
     _ | Can cause bottleneck due to weak links
    All nodes with equal access | No security

- Star topology
  - Every node is connected to a central node callled a hub or switch
  - Centralized Management
  - All traffic must pass through the hub or switch
  - Advantages | Disadvantages
    -----------|----------------
    Easy to design and implement. | Single point of failure affects the whole network.
    Centralized administration. | Bottleneck due to overloaded switch/Hub.
    Scalable. | Increased cost due to switch/hub.
  - Two star topologies can be connected by a repeater.

- Mesh topology
  - Each node is directly connected to every other nodes in the network
  - Fault tolerant and reliable.
  - Advantages | Disadvantages
    -----------|----------------
    Fault tolerant. | Issues with braodcasting messages
    Reliable | Expensive and impractical for large networks

- Hybrid topology
  - It contains one or more topologies

### Basic of IP addressing

- IP Adressing
  - IP stands for Internet Protocol.
  - Every node in the computer network is identified with the help of IP address.

- IP Address (IPV4)
  - Every node in the computer network is identified with the help of IP address.
  - Logical address: We can change based on the location of the device.
  - Assigned by manually or dynamically.
  - Represented in decimal and it has 4 octets (x.x.x.x).
  - 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (32 bits).
