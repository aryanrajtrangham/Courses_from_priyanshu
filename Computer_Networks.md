### Definition - Computer Network

- A computer network is a set of nodes connected by communication links
- A node can be a computer, printer or any other device capabele of sending / receiving data generated by other nodes in the network
  - Example: computer, server, printer, security camera etc.
- A communication link can be wired link or wireless link. The link carries the information.
  - links:  wired : cable, wireless: air.

### Network Protocols and Communication

- Data communication are the exchange of data between two nodes via some form of link (transmission medium) such as a cable.

- Data flow
  - Simplex:
    - Communication is undirectional
    - One device can transmit and the other device will receive
    - Example: keyboards, traditional monitors.
  - Half duplex
    - Communication is in both directional but not at the same time.
    - If one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa
    - Example: Walkie-talkies
  - Full deplex/ Duplex
    - Communication is in both directions simultaneously.
    - Device can send and receive at the same time.
    - Example: Telephone line.

- Protocols
  - All communication schemes will have the following things in common
    - Source or sender
    - Destination or receiver
    - Channel or media
  - Rules or protocols govern all methods of communication.
  - It is a set of rules that govern data communication.
  - Protocols determines
    - What is communicated ?
    - How it is communicated ?
    - When it is communicated ?
  - Protocols used in network communications also define
    - Message encoding
    - Message formatting and encapsultion

### Classification of Computer Network

- Local Area Network (LAN)
  - A local Area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computer within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.
  - LAN devices :
    - Wired LAN (Ex: Ethernet- Hub, Switch)
    - Wireless LAN (Ex: Wi-Fi)

- Metropolitan Area network (MAN)
  - A metropolitan area network is a computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area (City).
  - MAN devices :
    - Swithces/Hub
    - Router/Bridges

- Wide Area Network (WAN)
  - A wide area network (WAN) is a telecomunications network that extends over a large geographical area for the primary purpose of computer networking.
  - WAN devices :
    - End devices and intermediary devices

- New Trends
  - Bring your own device (BYOD)
  - Online collaboration
  - Cloud computing

- Storage Area network (SAN)
  - It is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.
  - Google drive
  - Azure storage service

### Network Topology

- Arrangement of nodes of a computer network.
- Topology = Layout
  - Physical Topology - Placement of various nodes.
  - Logical Topology - Deals with the data flow in the network

- Bus topology
  - All data transmitted between nodes in the network is transmitted over this *common transmission medium* and is able to be received by all nodes in the network simultaneously.
  - A signal containing the address of the intended receiving machine travels from a source machine in *both direction* to all machines connected to the bus until it finds the intended recipient.
  - Advantages |  Disadvantages
    -----------|-----------------
    Only one wire - less expensive | Not fault tolerant (No redundancy)
    Suited for temporary network   | Limited cable length
    Node failure does not affect other | No security

- Ring topology (Token ring topology)
  - A ring topology is a bus topology in a closed loop.
  - Peer-to-peer LAN topology
  - Two connections: one to each of its nearest neighbors
  - Unidirectional
  - Sending and receiving data takes place with the help of a *TOKEN*.
  - Advantages |  Disadvantages
    -----------|-----------------
    Performance better than Bus topology | Unidirectional. Single point of failure will affect the whole network
     _ | More load decreases the performance
     _ | Can cause bottleneck due to weak links
    All nodes with equal access | No security

- Star topology
  - Every node is connected to a central node callled a hub or switch
  - Centralized Management
  - All traffic must pass through the hub or switch
  - Advantages | Disadvantages
    -----------|----------------
    Easy to design and implement. | Single point of failure affects the whole network.
    Centralized administration. | Bottleneck due to overloaded switch/Hub.
    Scalable. | Increased cost due to switch/hub.
  - Two star topologies can be connected by a repeater.

- Mesh topology
  - Each node is directly connected to every other nodes in the network
  - Fault tolerant and reliable.
  - Advantages | Disadvantages
    -----------|----------------
    Fault tolerant. | Issues with braodcasting messages
    Reliable | Expensive and impractical for large networks

- Hybrid topology
  - It contains one or more topologies

### Basic of IP addressing

- IP Adressing
  - IP stands for Internet Protocol.
  - Every node in the computer network is identified with the help of IP address.

- IP Address (IPV4)
  - Every node in the computer network is identified with the help of IP address.
  - Logical address: We can change based on the location of the device.
  - Assigned by manually or dynamically.
  - Represented in decimal and it has 4 octets (x.x.x.x).
  - 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (32 bits).

### Basics of MAC addressing

- MAC stands for Media Access Control.
- MAC address = Physical address
- Every node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAC address.
- IP Address = Location of a person
- MAC Address = Name of the person

- MAC Address
  - Every node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAC address
  - Physical address or Hardware Address
  - Unique, cannot be cahnged
  - Assigned by the manufacturer
  - Represented in haxadecimal
  - Example: 70-20-84-00-ED-FC (48 bits)
  - Seperator: hyphen(-), period(.) and colon(:)

IP address | MAC Address |
-----------|-------------
Needed for communication. | Needed for communication.
32 bits | 48 bits
Represented in decimal. | Represented in hexadecimal.
Router needs IP Address to forward data | Switch needs MAC address to forward data.
Example : 10.10.23.56 | Example : 70-20-84-00-FD-FC

### Basics of Port addressing

- Derivations from analogy
  - Reaching our city = Reaching our network (IP address)
  - Reaching our Apartment = Reaching the host (MAC address)
  - Reaching the right person = Reaching the right process (Port address)

- Port Address or Port Numbers
  - In a node, many processes will be running
  - Data which are sent/received must reach the right process
  - Every process in a node is uniquely identified using port numbers
  - Port = Communication endpoint
  - Fixed port numbers and dynamic port numbers (0 - 65535)
  - Example :
    - Fixed port numbers: 25, 80 etc.
    - OS assigned dynamic port numbers: 62414.
  - Three key points : Before sending the data , any node must
    - Attach source IP address and destination IP address.
    - Attach source MAC address and destination MAC address.
    - Attach source port number and destination port number.

### Switching Techniques

- Swithching in computer network helps i deciding the best route for data transmission if there are multiple path in a larger network
- One-to-One connection.
- Switching Techniques
  - Circuit Switching
    - A dedicated path is established between the sender and receiver.
    - Before data transfer, connection will be established
    - Example: Telephone network
    - 3 phase in circuit switching
      - Connection establishment
      - Data transfer
      - Connection disconnection

  - Message Switching
    - Store and forward mechanism
    - Message is transferred as a complete unit and forwarded using store and forward mechanism at the intermediary node.
    - Not suited for streaming media and real-time applications.

  - Packet Switching
    - The internet is a packet switchd network.
    - Message is broken into individual chunks called as *packets*
    - Each packet is sent individually.
    - Each packet will have *source and destination IP address* with sequence number.
    - Sequence numbers help the receiver to -
      - Reorder the packets
      - Detect missing packets and
      - Send acknowledgments
    - Two approaches to packet switching
      - Datagram Approach
        - Datagram Packet Switching is also known as *connectionless switching*.
        - Each independent entity is called as datagram
        - Datagrams contain destination information and the intermediary device uses this information to forward datagrams to right destination.
        - In datagram Packet Switching aproach, the path is not fixed.
        - Intermediate nodes take the routing decisions to forward the packets
      - Virtual Circuit Approach
        - Virtual Circuit Switching is also known as *connection-oriented switching*.
        - In the case of Virtual circuit switching, a preplanned route is established before the messages are sent.
        - Call request and call accept packets are used to establish the connection between sender and receiver.
        - In this approach, the path is fixed for duration of a logical connection.

### Layering in Computer Networks

- Layering
  - Layering means decomposing the problem into more manageable components (layers).
  - Advantages :
    - It provides more modular design.
    - Easy to troubleshoot.

- Protocols
  - It is a set of rules that govern data communication.
  - The *protocols* in each layer governs the activities of the data communication.

- Layered Architectures
  - The OSI reference model
    - OSI = Open System Interconnection
    - It is a model for understanding and designing a network architecture that is flexible, robust and interoperable
    - Developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO)
    - The OSI model is not a *protocol*.
    - It is only a guideline and hence it is refererred as OSI reference model.
    - The purpose of OSI model is to show how to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of underlying hardware and software.
    - The OSI model was never fully implemented. (It's just a guidline)

  - The TCP/IP model
    - TCP/IP = Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.
    - The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed prior to the OSI model.
    - Therefore, the layers in the TCP/IP protocol suite do not exactly match those in the OSI model.
    - *TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol* made up of interactive modules, each of which provides a specific functionality.
