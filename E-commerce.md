# E-Commerce

- E-Commerce is about conducting commercial transactions via the web or getting involved in selling and buying items over the internet. It also covers monetary transactions. Some other online e-commerce activities include:
  - Ticketing over internet
  - Paying different taxes
  - Online payments
  - Products purchased or sold online
  - Online Accounting Software
  - Online Customer Support
  - Examples of E-Commerce sites. They include Flipkart, Paytm Mall, Amazon, Myntra and more.

## Advantages of E-Commerce

- ### Faster buying process
  
Customers can spend less time shopping for what they want. They can easily browse through many items at a time and buy what they like. When online, customers can find items that are available in physical stores far away from them or not found in their locality.

- ### Store and product listing creation
  
A product listing is what the customer sees when they search for an item. This is one advantage in ecommerce meant for the seller. This online business plus point is that you can personalise your product listing after creating them.

Customising listings makes them attractive and appealing. Here the seller has full control over customisation, he can mention offers available, discounts etc. Other advantages of e-business product listing are that it is free to upload and fast.

- ### Cost reduction

One of the biggest advantages of ecommerce to business that keep sellers interested in online selling is cost reduction. Many sellers have to pay lots to maintain their physical store. They may need to pay extra up front costs like rent, repairs, store design, inventory etc. In many cases, even after investing in services, stock, maintenance and workforce, sellers don’t receive desired profits.

- ### Affordable advertising and marketing

Sellers don’t have to spend a lot of money to promote their items. The world of ecommerce has several affordable, quick ways to market online. Ecommerce marketplaces are visual channels – and sellers can really show off their product. For example, Amazon sellers can use Advertising tools to add videos, infographics, good quality resolution images.

- ### Flexibility for customers

An important advantage of ecommerce to business is that sellers can provide flexibility to customers. One highlight is that the product and services are ready 24x7. The result is that seller can offer his item any place, any time.

- ### Product and price comparison

In ecommerce, sellers can compare the products using tools or on their own. This gives them a good idea of product alternatives available, the standard rates, if a product need is unfulfilled.
Comparison is faster online and covers many products - It helps to save time when making this comparison, as all details are available on the shopping site. In a physical store, sellers may not be able get access to so many details –they only have better knowledge about their own inventory.

- ### No reach limitations

A seller with a physical store may only be able to reach a certain number of buyers. They can deliver to the customers’ homes but there can be distance limitations. Several e-commerce marketplaces have their own logistics and delivery system.
Reaching out to more customers - Sellers that need to expand their reach to find new customers can benefit from this. This applies to online-only sellers and those with a physical store.

- ### Faster response to buyer/market demands

Every interaction is faster when begin selling online. Ecommerce marketplaces offer a streamlined logistics or delivery system. What this means is that the buyers order gets delivered efficiently. Product returns management is can be handled quickly – you either refund the payments or give a replacement.
Speedily actions can even be applied when responding to market demands. As in case of this ecommerce example - when a buyer sees that an item is out of stock, he can click on the ‘Notify Me’ option. This informs him when that item is available for sale again. It also informs sellers that they need to restock that item so they can get more buyers.

- ### Several payment modes

Buyers like personalisation – the same goes for paying for their orders. Ecommerce marketplaces permit multiple payment modes that include UPI, cash on delivery, card on delivery, net banking, EMIs on credit or debit card and pay-later credit facility.

## What is E-Business?

- E-Business encompasses executing all types of business transactions and services via the web. This includes procuring raw materials, online education, commercial transactions, monetary transactions on the internet and more. This indicates an online presence of all types of businesses and services.
- Examples are E-Commerce companies and their additional internal business activities such as classifieds, auction sites, software or hardware developer sites, etc. The E-Business online activities, in the meantime, include:
  - Setting up an online store
  - Supply chain management
  - Online commercial transactions (buying and selling products)
  - Customer Education
  - Monetary Business Transactions
  - E-Mail Marketing

## Difference between E-Commerce and E-Business

- While E-Commerce may refer to conducting online transactions, E-Business encompasses all the business activities and services conducted using the web

- E- Commerce                     |   E-Bussiness
  --------------------------------|--------------------------------
  Carrying out commercial transactions online | Conducts all kinds of business activities and services over the internet
  Buying/ selling, monetary transactions online | Online presence of the business
  A sub-set of E-Business, it is also a narrow concept | A super-set of E-Commerce. Business transactions are supported in E-Business
  Limited transactions | Transactions are not limited
  Involves use of only one website | Multiple websites and CRMs, ERPs that connect different business processes are used
  Mandatory use of internet | Internet, Intranet or Extranet are used
  It is more relevant in B2C, Business to customer context | This is more appropriate to B2B or Business to Business context
  Also cover external or outward business processes | Covers internal as well as external business activities or processes

## Difference between Traditional Commerce and E-Commerce

- Traditional Commerce            | E-Commerce
  --------------------------------|--------------------------------
  Heavy dependency on information exchange from person to person. | Information sharing is made easy via electronic communication channels making little dependency on person to person information exchange.
  Communication/ transaction are done in synchronous way. Manual intervention is required for each communication or transaction. | Communication or transaction can be done in asynchronous way. Electronics system automatically handles when to pass communication to required person or do the transactions.
  It is difficult to establish and maintain standard practices in traditional commerce. | A uniform strategy can be easily established and maintain in e-commerce.
  Communications of business depends upon individual skills. | In e-Commerce or Electronic Market, there is no human intervention.
  Unavailability of a uniform platform as traditional commerce depends heavily on personal communication. | E-Commerce website provides user a platform where al l information is available at one place.
  No uniform platform for information sharing as it depends heavily on personal communication. | E-Commerce provides a universal platform to support commercial / business activities across the globe.

## Explain the Commercial Transaction Process in E-Commerce

- Commercial transactions are exchanges that involve some sort of payment for a good or service. These types of transactions are usually governed by commercial law and must follow specific guidelines. There are many forms of business transactions, including those that occur between two separate businesses, consumers and businesses, between internal divisions of a company and between two individual consumers.
- Exchanges of money for a product or professional service are usually classified as commercial transactions. Some of the more obvious exchanges of this nature include a consumer purchasing goods in a retail store and a manufacturer selling its products to wholesale companies. Commercial transactions can occur in a physical store location, online, or through direct interaction with a sales representative or direct seller. The exchange of money may happen at the time the goods or services are delivered, beforehand or after the fact.
- Commercial trade can happen on a large or small scale. Much of the global economy is dependent upon the level of commercial transactions or activities. Suppliers sell raw materials and goods to other companies that may re-sell them or use the supplies in their manufacturing processes. Goods are marketed and sold to consumers who may use them for personal or business use. At some point these goods may be re-sold in private auctions or to second hand retailers.
- Transactions may be visible or occur behind the scenes. While store transactions are able to be observed by any casual consumer and business personnel, commercial transactions that happen between two private individuals or through direct channels may not be so noticeable. Manufacturers' sales representatives may draw up purchasing contracts, make presentations, deliver and merchandise products that are eventually purchased by end consumers. In addition, there are many direct and multi-level marketing companies that sell to consumers directly without the use of a retailer or wholesaler.
- Extra
  - Commercial activity can also include activities such as corporate advertising and internal relationships between corporations and service providers, such as human resources and accounting vendors. Regardless of the type of commercial transaction, there are usually laws that govern what can and cannot occur. This legislation is often referred to as commercial law. For example, consumers usually have three days after a purchase commitment is made on certain goods to change their minds without any financial implications.

## What is EDI envelope for message?

- EDI stands for Electronic Data Interchange.An EDI data structure resembles layers of envelopes. The envelopes separate different types of data and carry the sender and receiver address information. A receiver uses these envelopes to determine if all of the data has been received.
- A envelope consists of a header segment, a trailer segment, and EDI data. EDI envelopes are like paper envelopes that enclose paper documents.
- A header segment is the first EDI data segment in an envelope. The header segment contains a control number data element that identifies the envelope.
- A trailer segment is the last EDI data segment in an envelope. The trailer segment contains a unique control number and the number of segments in the envelope. The control number in the header segment must match the control number in the trailer segment.
- The following figure shows the EDI envelope structure:

- ```[]
              Envelope
          ____________________________
      +-->| Envelope header segment  |
      |   ----------------------------
      |   ____________________________
      |   |                          |
      |   |   Envelop contents       |
      |   |__________________________|
      |   ____________________________
      +-->| Envelope trailer segment |
          ----------------------------
  ```

## E-commerce business models can generally be categorized into the following categories

- Business - to - Business (B2B)
- Business - to - Consumer (B2C)
- Consumer - to - Consumer (C2C)
- Consumer - to - Business (C2B)
- Business - to - Government (B2G)
- Government - to - Business (G2B)
- Government - to - Citizen (G2C)

## Debit Card

- Debit card, like credit card, is a small plastic card with a unique number mapped with the bank account number. It is required to have a bank account before getting a debit card from the bank. The major difference between a debit card and a credit card is that in case of payment through debit card, the amount gets deducted from the card's bank account immediately and there should be sufficient balance in the bank account for the transaction to get completed; whereas in case of a credit card transaction, there is no such compulsion.
- Debit cards free the customer to carry cash and cheques. Even merchants accept a debit card readily. Having a restriction on the amount that can be withdrawn in a day using a debit card helps the customer to keep a check on his/her spending.

## Smart Card

- Smart card is similar to a credit card or a debit card in appearance, but it has a small microprocessor chip embedded in it. It has the capacity to store a customer’s work-related and/or personal information. Smart cards are also used to store money and the amount gets deducted after every transaction.
- Smart cards can only be accessed using a PIN that every customer is assigned with. Smart cards are secure, as they store information in encrypted format and are less expensive/provides faster processing. Mondex and Visa Cash cards are examples of smart cards.

## E-Money

- E-Money transactions refer to situation where payment is done over the network and the amount gets transferred from one financial body to another financial body without any involvement of a middleman. E-money transactions are faster, convenient, and saves a lot of time.
- Online payments done via credit cards, debit cards, or smart cards are examples of emoney transactions. Another popular example is e-cash. In case of e-cash, both customer and merchant have to sign up with the bank or company issuing e-cash.

## Digital Signature

- A digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital document. It's the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or stamped seal, but it offers far more inherent security. A digital signature is intended to solve the problem of tampering and impersonation in digital communications.
- Digital signatures can provide evidence of origin, identity and status of electronic documents, transactions or digital messages. Signers can also use them to acknowledge informed consent

## How do digital signatures work?

- Digital signatures are based on public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography. Using a public key algorithm, such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), two keys are generated, creating a mathematically linked pair of keys, one private and one public.
- Digital signatures work through public key cryptography's two mutually authenticating cryptographic keys. The individual who creates the digital signature uses a private key to encrypt signature-related data, while the only way to decrypt that data is with the signer's public key i.e,
Acknowledgement or the signature. This is how digital signatures are authenticated.
- Digital signature technology requires all parties trust that the individual creating the signature has kept the private key secret. If someone else has access to the private signing key, that party could create fraudulent digital signatures in the name of the private key holder.

## Digital Currency

- Digital currency is a form of currency that is available only in digital or electronic form. It is also called digital money, electronic money, electronic currency, or cybercash.
  - Digital currencies are currencies that are only accessible with computers or mobile phones because they only exist in electronic form.
  - Typical digital currencies do not require intermediaries and are often the cheapest method for trading currencies.
  - All cryptocurrencies are digital currencies, but not all digital currencies are cryptocurrencies.
  - Some of the advantages of digital currencies are that they enable seamless transfer of value and can make transaction costs cheaper.
  - Some of the disadvantages of digital currencies are that they can volatile to trade and are susceptible to hacks.

## More on digital currencies

- Digital currencies do not have physical attributes and are available only in digital form. Transactions involving digital currencies are made using computers or electronic wallets connected to the internet or designated networks. In contrast, physical currencies, such as banknotes and minted coins, are tangible, meaning they have definite physical attributes and characteristics. Transactions involving such currencies are made possible only when their holders have physical possession of these currencies.

- Digital currencies have utility similar to that of physical currencies. They can be used to purchase goods and pay for services. They can also find restricted use among certain online communities, such as gaming sites, gambling portals, or social networks.

- Digital currencies also enable instant transactions that can be seamlessly executed across borders. For instance, it is possible for a person located in the United States to make payments in digital currency to a counterparty residing in Singapore, provided they are both connected to the same network.

## Characteristics of Digital Currencies

- Digital currencies only exist in digital form. They may not have a physical equivalent.
- Digital currencies can be centralized or decentralized. Fiat currency, which exists in physical form, is a centralized system of production and distribution by a central bank and government agencies. Prominent cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are examples of decentralized digital currency systems.
- Digital currencies can transfer value. Use of digital currencies requires a mental shift in the existing framework for currencies, where they are associated with sale and purchase transactions for goods and services. Digital currencies, however, extend the concept. For example, a gaming network token can extend the life of a player or provide them with extra superpowers. This is not a purchase or sale transaction but, instead, represents a transfer of value.

## Types of Digital Currencies

- Digital currency is an overarching term that can be used to describe different types of currencies that exist in the electronic realm. Broadly, there are three different types of currencies:

- ### Cryptocurrencies
  
Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use cryptography to secure and verify transactions in a network. Cryptography is also used to manage and control the creation of such currencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of cryptocurrencies. Depending on the jurisdiction, cryptocurrencies may or may not be regulated.
Cryptocurrencies are considered virtual currencies because they are unregulated and exist only in digital form.

- ### Virtual Currencies

Virtual currencies are unregulated digital currencies controlled by developers or a founding organization consisting of various stakeholders involved in the process. Virtual currencies can also be algorithmically controlled by a defined network protocol. An example of a virtual currency is a gaming network token whose economics is defined and controlled by developers.

- ### Central Bank Digital Currencies

Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are regulated digital currencies issued by the central bank of a country. A CBDC can be a supplement or a replacement to traditional fiat currency. Unlike fiat currency, which exists in both physical and digital form, a CBDC exists purely in digital form. England, Sweden, and Uruguay are a few of the nations that are considering plans to launch a digital version of their native fiat currencies.
- Digital Currencies | Virtual Currencies | Cryptocurrencies
  -----------------|--------------------|-------------------
  Regulated or unregulated currency that is available only in digital or electronic form. | An unregulated digital currency that is controlled by its developer(s), its founding organization, or its defined network protocol. | A virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to manage and control the creation of new currency units.

## Advantages of Digital Currencies

- They have fast transfer and transaction times
</br>Because digital currencies generally exist within the same network and accomplish transfers without intermediaries, the amount of time required for transfers involving digital currencies is extremely fast. As payments in digital currencies are made directly between the transacting parties without the need for any intermediaries, the transactions are usually instantaneous and low-cost. This fares better compared to traditional payment methods that involve banks or clearinghouses. Digital-currency-based electronic transactions also bring in the necessary record keeping and transparency in dealings.
- They do not require physical manufacturing and cannot be soiled
</br>Many requirements for physical currencies, such as the establishment of physical manufacturing facilities, are absent for digital currencies.
- They can ease implementation of monetary and fiscal policy
</br>Under the current currency regime, the Fed works through a series of intermediaries—banks and financial institutions—to circulate money into an economy. CBDCs can help circumvent this mechanism and enable a government agency to enable disburse payments directly to citizens. They also simplify the production and distribution methods by obviating the need for physical manufacturing and transportation of currency notes from one location to another.
- They can make transaction costs cheaper
</br>Digital currencies enable direct interactions within a network. For example, a customer can pay a shopkeeper directly as long as they are situated in the same network. Even costs involving digital currency transactions between different networks are relatively cheaper as compared to those with physical or fiat currencies. By cutting out middlemen that seek economic rent from processing the transaction, digital currencies can make the overall cost of a transaction cheaper.

## Disadvantages of Digital Currencies

- They do not solve all storage and infrastructure problems
While they do not require physical wallets, digital currencies have their own set of requirements for storage and processing. For example, an Internet connection is necessary as are smartphones and services related to their provisioning. Online wallets with robust security are also necessary to store digital currencies.

- They are susceptible to hacking
</br>Their digital provenance makes digital currencies susceptible to hacking. Hackers can steal digital currencies from online wallets or change the protocol for digital currencies, making them unusable. As the numerous cases of hacks in cryptocurrencies have proved, securing digital systems and currencies is a work-in-progress.

- They can be volatile in value
</br>Digital currencies used for trading can have wild price swings. For example, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies has resulted in a profusion of thinly capitalized digital currencies whose prices are prone to sudden changes based on investor whims. Other digital currencies have followed a similar price trajectory during their initial days. For example, Linden dollars used in the online game Second Life had a similarly volatile price trajectory in its early days.

## What is an Intelligent Agent?

- An (intelligent) agent perceives it environment via sensors and acts rationally upon that environment with its effectors. Hence, an agent gets percepts one at a time, and maps this percept sequence to actions.

## Agent Characteristics

- Situatedness
</br>The agent receives some form of sensory input from its environment, and it performs some action that changes its environment in some way. Examples of environments: the physical world and the Internet.
- Autonomy
</br>The agent can act without direct intervention by humans or other agents and that it has control over its own actions and internal state.
- Adaptivity
</br>The agent is capable of
  - reacting flexibly to changes in its environment;
  - taking goal-directed initiative (i.e., is pro-active), when appropriate;
  - learning from its own experience, its environment, and interactions with others.
- Sociability
</br>The agent is capable of interacting in a peer-to-peer manner with other agents or humans.

## Approaches to Agent Design

- Simple Reflex Agent
- A lookup table is made for percept-action pairs defining all possible condition - action rules necessary to interact in an environment
- Problems
  - Too big to generate and to store (Chess has about 10120 states, for example)
  - No knowledge of non-perceptual parts of the current state
  - Not adaptive to changes in the environment; requires entire table to be updated if changes occur
  - Looping: Can't make actions conditional
- Reflex Agent with Internal State
  - Encode "internal state" of the world to remember the past as contained in earlier percepts
  - Needed because sensors do not usually give the entire state of the world at each input, so perception of the environment is captured over time. "State" used to encode different "world states" that generate the same immediate percept.
  - Requires ability to represent change in the world; one possibility is to represent just the latest state, but then can't reason about hypothetical courses of action
  - Example: Rodney Brooks's Subsumption Architecture Main idea: build complex, intelligent robots by decomposing behaviors into a hierarchy of skills, each completely defining a complete percept-action cycle for one very specific task. For example, avoiding contact, wandering, exploring, recognizing doorways, etc. Each behavior is modeled by a finite-state machine with a few states (though each state may correspond to a complex function or module). Behaviors are loosely-coupled, asynchronous interactions.
- Goal-Based Agent
  - Choose actions so as to achieve a (given or computed) goal : a description of a desirable situation
  - Keeping track of the current state is often not enough, so we need to add goals to decide which situations are good
  - Deliberative instead of reactive
  - May have to consider long sequences of possible actions before deciding if goal is achieved, as it involves consideration of the future, "what would happen if I do this..."
- Utility-Based Agent
  - When there are multiple possible alternatives, how to decide which one is best?
  - A goal specifies a crude distinction between a happy and unhappy state, but often need a more general performance measure that describes "degree of happiness"
  - Utility function U: State --> Reals indicating a measure of success or happiness when at a given state
  - Allows decisions comparing choice between conflicting goals, and choice between likelihood of success and importance of goal (if achievement is uncertain)

## How can the risk involved in online payment may be reduced by internet governance?

- The risk associated with online payment may be mitigated by internet governance through the adoption of occasional review of the set security procedure. In addition to this, the security guidelines must reveal the roles and duties including the peril management function of the concerned personnel

## Define Cybercash

- Cybercash refers to a business payment option that necessitates a user to buy digital cash credits for use in enabling electronic commercial dealings through the Internet.

## Discuss Cybercash in detail

- A commercial payment system whereby a user digitally purchases cash credits and then spends them when making electronic purchases over the Internet. Most merchants accepting digital cash use it as an alternative to other forms of payment, such as credit cards.

- CyberCash will provide two classes of payment services, customer to merchant and peer to peer. Customer to merchant payments include credit card and debit card. For customer to merchant payments, there are three parties connected to the Internet, the customer, the merchant and the CyberCash server. A customer will engage in a dialog with the merchant's web server, eventually arriving at a decision to buy some goods or services. All of the dialog related to the sale is under control of the merchant until it's time to make the payment. At that point, the merchant presents the user with the amount to be paid and a transaction identifier, and then turns control over to the CyberCash payment system.

## What is virtual Internet payment system?

- A Virtual Internet payment system refers to a digital-based form of a credit card payment gadget that makes it possible for business people to accept business transactions via Web, phone or mail.

## Give the uses of smart cards

- Some of the uses of smart cards include data storage, individual authentication and processing application such mobile phone based simcards.

## SSL Security Definition

- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client — typically a web server (website) and a browser, or a mail server and a mail client (e.g., Outlook). SSL security safeguards sensitive data such as credit card numbers and financial information, from capture or modification as two systems send and receive it, to prevent unauthorized users from accessing, reading, or modifying any personal information.
- The two systems transferring the information might both be servers, as when an application accesses sensitive information. The systems might also be a client and a server, as when a user buys things on an e-commerce website through their web browser.
- To protect the sensitive data in transmission, SSL security encrypts the information using algorithms, rendering it unreadable during the transfer between sites, systems, and/or users. Various versions of SSL security protocols are widespread use in applications such as email, chatting and instant messaging, voice over IP (VoIP), and web browsing.

      Application / End Users                         Web servers
  ```

## What is SSL Security?

- SSL is a security protocol that determines how to encrypt data using specific algorithms. The secure socket layer SSL protocol assesses both the data to transmit and the link, and determines encryption variables for both.
- SSL security technology establishes encrypted links between clients and servers. For example, it scrambles sensitive information transferred between a client, often a website, and a user, often a browser or mail server.
- The default mode of communication between web servers and browsers allows data to be sent in plain text. This leaves users vulnerable to hackers who can “see” information they intercept. SSL encrypts sensitive details such as login credentials, social security numbers, and bank information so that unauthorized users cannot interpret and use the data, even if they see it.
- The lock icon users see on SSL-secured websites and the “https” address indicate that a secure connection is present. Sites with a green address bar have an Extended Validation SSL-secured website. These visual signals are sometimes called **EV indicators**.
- Although any web browser is able to use the SSL protocol to interact with secured web servers, both the server and the browser must have an SSL certificate to establish a secure connection.

## What is an SSL Security Certificate?

- A SSL security certificate identifies the certificate/website owner in its subject. SSL security certificates also contain a pair of public and private cryptographic keys they use to establish an encrypted connection.
- There are several steps to get a SSL or TLS certificate:
  - Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) on your server to generate a public key and a private key.
  - Send the CSR data file called a Certificate Authority or CA to the SSL certificate issuer.
  - The CA contains the public key which the CA uses along with the rest of the CSR data file to match your private key with a data structure. The CA never sees the private key, nor is it compromised.
- The certificate issuer gives the SSL certificate. Both the SSL certificate and an intermediate certificate installed establishes its credibility on the server. Depending on the server and the other facts the install and test the SSL certificate will vary.
- When browser connects to the SSL certificate on server, the SSL (or TLS) protocol begins to encrypt any transferred information.

## Define Secure Electronic Transaction (SET)

- Secure Electronic Transaction or SET is a system that ensures the security and integrity of electronic transactions done using credit cards in a scenario. SET is not some system that enables payment but it is a security protocol applied to those payments. It uses different encryption and hashing techniques to secure payments over the internet done through credit cards. The SET protocol was supported in development by major organizations like Visa, Mastercard, Microsoft which provided its Secure Transaction Technology (STT), and Netscape which provided the technology of Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
- SET protocol restricts the revealing of credit card details to merchants thus keeping hackers and thieves at bay. The SET protocol includes Certification Authorities for making use of standard Digital Certificates like X.509 Certificate.

- ```[]
    _________________    ___________________    _________________
    | Customer      |<-->| Payment gateway |<-->| Merchant      |
    | Financial     |    -------------------    | Financial     |
    | Institution   |<------------------------->| Institution   |
    -----------------                           -----------------
  ```

## Requirements in SET

- The SET protocol has some requirements to meet, some of the important requirements are
  - It has to provide mutual authentication i.e., customer (or cardholder) authentication by confirming if the customer is an intended user or not, and merchant authentication.
  - It has to keep the PI (Payment Information) and OI (Order Information) confidential by appropriate encryptions.
  - It has to be resistive against message modifications i.e., no changes should be allowed in the content being transmitted.
  - SET also needs to provide interoperability and make use of the best security mechanisms.

## SET functionalities

- **Provide Authentication**

  - **Merchant Authentication** – To prevent theft, SET allows customers to check previous relationships between merchants and financial institutions. Standard X.509V3 certificates are used for this verification.
  - **Customer / Cardholder Authentication** – SET checks if the use of a credit card is done by an authorized user or not using X.509V3 certificates.

- **Provide Message Confidentiality** Confidentiality refers to preventing unintended people from reading the message being transferred. SET implements confidentiality by using encryption techniques. Traditionally DES is used for encryption purposes.

- **Provide Message Integrity** SET doesn’t allow message modification with the help of signatures. Messages are protected against unauthorized modification using RSA digital signatures with SHA-1 and some using HMAC with SHA-1.

## Explain the Legal issues of Internet Commerce

There are various legal issues associated with E-Commerce businesses. If these issues are not taken care of in time, they can lead to serious problems for a business

- **Incorporation Problem**
    If the company has operated merely via a website, not being incorporated is a crucial problem. Any purchase and selling activity related to the products will be considered illegal and you can’t claim your right in case of any fraud and corruption. Without incorporation, the business has no shelter.

- **Trademark Security Problem**
    Not getting trademark protected is one of the main legal issues in the field of E-Commerce. Since trademark is the company’s logo and symbol, the representation of  business all over the web, it must be protected. If it is not secure , it won’t take long before you realize your trademark is being infringed upon. This is very common legal issue and can become a deadly threat to  e-business.
    With the hackers on loose and cybercrime so common, trademark infringement of the business or by your business can be a serious legal matter and may hinder the business’s progress

- **Copyright Protection Issue**
    While publishing content for  E-Commerce website, using content of any other company can be a severe legal problem. This might mark an end to your e-business. There are many sites online which are royalty free and allow you to access their content and images. You may use those sites for creating web content for your business site. Even if you unintentionally used copyrighted content, the other party can easily sue your business.

- **Transaction Issues**
    If we do not abide by the rules, we can get into serious law violation problems. If the business fails to provide clear and complete description of the product, cost and purchase details, information about delivery i.e. when the customer will receive products and other information related to exchange and refunds,  Consumer Law can impose penalties on the business.

- **Privacy Issues**
    When it comes to online businesses, privacy is the major issue that can create problems both for the business and customers. Consumers share information with businesses online and they expect the sellers to keep their information confidential. By just one minor mistake and leakage of valuable information of a customer, we will not only lose our potential customer but the image and reputation will become a question mark.

## Discuss the E-commerce Architecture in detail with the help of a diagram

The E-commerce Architecture:

- It helps search engine (SE) to index the website and rank it higher
- It allow for scalability
- It enable third party integration
- It enhances the user experience
- The 3 architectures are

- **Two - Tier Architecture**
  - Two sides of the architecture ( client and database ) that corresponding to client domain and business database domain. Their exist in constant interaction.
  Example Retreiving and storing account billing details in db.

    ```

  - Used for homogenous environment as it contain static business rules
  - A preferred model for startups however also contain some limitations
  - **Pros**
    - Simple, fast & cheap to develop & deploy
    - Allows for accurate & fast prototyping
    - DB server & business logic are done, which enhances performance
  - **Cons**
    - Not suitable for heterogenous environment
    - Allows for limited no of users & isn't scalable
    - Low control & re-distribution level
    - Complicated to change DB structure due to mutual depandenct component and monolithic code.
- **Three - Tier Architecture**
  - An additional middle layer is added which can be considered server side
  - 3 layers
    - Presentaion layer (client)
    - Application layer (business logic)
    - Database layer (database)

      ```

  - Each layer function independently, runs on different services & is treated as a separate module when it comes to its development, modification or maintaince
  - **Pros**
    - Improved Security due to better sync between the modules
    - Security level is enhanced
    - Possible partial update without affecting whole system
    - Availablitity even if server is down due to cache data
  - **Cons**
    - Complex communication between layers (difficult implementation)
    - Requires manual management
- **E-Commerce Microserver Architecture**
  - It means the creation of the application/website by arranging multiple services that have less comploy
  depending between each other

## Explain the concept of mercantile process model from consumer and merchant's perspective

### Mercantile process model from consumers perspective

- Mercantile process define interaction model between consumers and merchants for E commerce
- The online consumer expects quality, convenience, value, low price and control. To understand The behavior of online shoppers, there is a need for business model. This business model for consumers perspective consists of seven activities that can be grouped into three phases
  - Pre purchase phase
    - Product service and discovery in information space
    - Camparision shoping and product selection based on various attributes
    - Negotiation of terms e.g, Price, Delivery times
  - Purchase consumation face
    - Placement of order
    - Authorization of Payment
    - Receipt of payment
  - Post purchase interaction phase.
    - Customer service and support
- **Pre purchase phase** Search and discovery for set of product in layers. Important space capable of meeting consumer requirements and selection from small sets of product based on attribute comparison.
  - Types of buyers
    - Impulsive buyers
    - Patient buyers
    - Analytical buyers
  - Types of purchases
    - Specially planned purchases
    - Generally planned purchases
    - Reminder purchases
    - Entirely unplanned purchases
  - Types of collecting information
    - The Consumer information search process
    - The organization information search process
    - Consumer search experience
    - Information brokers and brokerage
- **Purchase consumation** Include mercantile protocol that specifies flow of information and documents associated with purchasing and negotiating with merchants for suitable terms.
  - Mode of payments
    - Mercantile Process using digital cash
    - Mercantile Process using credit card
- **Post purchase interaction** Includes and support to address customer complaint, product return and product defects.Product return and product defects.

## Mercantile process model from merchants perspective

- To order to deliver cycle from merchant perspective has been managed with the eye towards standardization and cost.
- This is based on assumtion that the organization must create a set of operating standards for service and production.They perform to those standards while minimizing the cost.
- To fully realize and maintain a competitive advantage in the online environment, it is necessary to examine the order management cycle(OMC) that also includes the traditional order to delivery cycle.
- Steps of OMC
  - Presale Interaction
    - Order planning and order generation
    - Cost estimation and pricing
  - Service production and delivery
    - Order recept an entry
    - Order selection and prioritization
    - Order scheduling
    - Order fulfillment and delivery
  - Post sale Interaction
    - Order billing and account payment/management
    - Post sales service

## Three primary element of supply chain management

- Manufacturing and production- Mainly deals with the creation of goods and services.
- Distribution- Makes goods and available to retailers and consumers.
- Returns/income management- Controls all procurement processes and manages transactions
